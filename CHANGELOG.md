## [0.3.0](https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun/compare/v0.2.0...v0.3.0)
### Overview & Highlights

After a successful launch a couple of weeks ago, we're back with our second release!
With a few exceptions this release focuses on internal refactors & improving our processes.
However, we think you'll enjoy these goodies that made it in nonetheless!

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2910679/222510504-23871b8c-0bef-49c2-bbd2-37baab4247e8.mp4


You can now generate point clouds directly from depth textures and choose a wide variety of color maps.
Check out this [video](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1220815/223365363-da13585f-3a91-4cb8-a6ef-8a6fadbeb4eb.webm) on how to use it.
This is **a lot** faster and more convenient than doing so manually in your own code
Some caveats: Picking is not yet working and visible history may behave differently (related to [#723](https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun/issues/723))

Other highlights:

* Viewer
  * Improved formatting of date-times in plots [#1356](https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun/pull/1356)
  * Labels for 3D objects have now a color can now be selected & hovered [#1438](https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun/pull/1438)
  * Scale factor is saved across sessions and more persistent between screens [#1448](https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun/pull/1448)
  * Showing tensors in the viewer is now faster
* SDK
  * Python packages now work with Ubuntu-20.04 [#1334](https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun/pull/1334)
  * u8 segmentation stay u8 now (they converted to u16 before) [#1376](https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun/pull/1376)
  * 2D Line strips can now be logged directly [#1430](https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun/pull/1430)
  * Add a `strict` mode to the Python SDK where misuses of the API result in exceptions being raised.[#1477](https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun/pull/1477)
  * Fix disabling Python API through `init` not working [#1517](https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun/pull/1517)
* General
  * We build now with fewer build dependencies (there is however [still more work to do!](https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun/issues/1316)).
  Notably, we previously used a version of the `time` crate which had a security issue (CVE-2020-26235), thanks @mpizenberg for helping out!
  * Print more information & troubleshooting info on crash

Meanwhile, we did a bunch of improvements to our manual. If you had trouble running Rerun so far, check our updated [troubleshooting](https://www.rerun.io/docs/getting-started/troubleshooting) page (and as always, please [open an issue](https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun/issues/new/choose) if something doesn't work).
