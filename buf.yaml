# Config for <https://buf.build>.
#
# This is intentionally put at the root of the repository rather than specifically in the proto folder because:
# A) It makes working with all the `buf` tooling much nicer for users of the codebase.
# B) We don't know how the way we store our proto files will evolve.
# This is worth a bit of root pollution.
#
# For details on buf.yaml configuration, visit <https://buf.build/docs/configuration/v2/buf-yaml>.
