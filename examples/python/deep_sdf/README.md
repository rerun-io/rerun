Generate Signed Distance Fields for arbitrary meshes using both traditional methods as well as the one described in the [DeepSDF paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.05103), and visualize the results using the Rerun SDK.

```bash
pip install -r examples/python/deep_sdf/requirements.txt
python examples/python/deep_sdf/main.py
```
