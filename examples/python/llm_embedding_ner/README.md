## Used Rerun types
[`TextDocument`](https://www.rerun.io/docs/reference/types/archetypes/text_document), [`AnnotationContext`](https://www.rerun.io/docs/reference/types/archetypes/annotation_context), [`Points3D`](https://www.rerun.io/docs/reference/types/archetypes/points3d)

## Background
This example splits text into tokens, feeds the token sequence into a large language model (BERT), which outputs an embedding per token.
The embeddings are then classified into four types of entities: location (LOC), organizations (ORG), person (PER) and Miscellaneous (MISC). The embeddings are projected to a 3D space using [UMAP](https://umap-learn.readthedocs.io/en/latest), and visualized together with all other data in Rerun.

## Logging and visualizing with Rerun
The visualizations in this example were created with the following Rerun code:

### Text
The logging begins with the original text. Following this, the tokenized version is logged for further analysis, and the named entities identified by the NER model are logged separately.
All texts are logged using [`TextDocument`](https://www.rerun.io/docs/reference/types/archetypes/text_document) as a Markdown document to preserves structure and formatting.

#### Original text
```python
rr.log("text", rr.TextDocument(text, media_type=rr.MediaType.MARKDOWN))
```

#### Tokenized text
```python
rr.log("tokenized_text", rr.TextDocument(markdown, media_type=rr.MediaType.MARKDOWN))
```

#### Named entities
```python
rr.log("named_entities", rr.TextDocument(named_entities_str, media_type=rr.MediaType.MARKDOWN))
```

### UMAP embeddings

UMAP is used in this example for dimensionality reduction and visualization of the embeddings generated by a Named Entity Recognition (NER) model.
UMAP preserves the essential structure and relationships between data points, and helps in identifying clusters or patterns within the named entities.

After transforming the embeddings to UMAP, the next step involves defining labels for classes using [`AnnotationContext`](https://www.rerun.io/docs/reference/types/archetypes/annotation_context).
These labels help in interpreting the visualized data.
Subsequently, the UMAP embeddings are logged as [`Points3D`](https://www.rerun.io/docs/reference/types/archetypes/points3d) and visualized in a three-dimensional space.
The visualization can provide insights into how the NER model is performing and how different types of entities are distributed throughout the text.


```python
# Define label for classes and set none class color to dark gray
annotation_context = [
    rr.AnnotationInfo(id=0, color=(30, 30, 30)),
    rr.AnnotationInfo(id=1, label="Location"),
    rr.AnnotationInfo(id=2, label="Person"),
    rr.AnnotationInfo(id=3, label="Organization"),
    rr.AnnotationInfo(id=4, label="Miscellaneous"),
]
rr.log("/", rr.AnnotationContext(annotation_context))
```

```python
rr.log(
    "umap_embeddings",
    rr.Points3D(umap_embeddings, class_ids=class_ids),
    rr.AnyValues(**{"Token": token_words, "Named Entity": entity_per_token(token_words, ner_results)}),
)
```


## Run the code
To run this example, make sure you have the Rerun repository checked out and the latest SDK installed:
```bash
pip install --upgrade rerun-sdk  # install the latest Rerun SDK
git clone git@github.com:rerun-io/rerun.git  # Clone the repository
cd rerun
git checkout latest  # Check out the commit matching the latest SDK release
```
Install the necessary libraries specified in the requirements file:
```bash
pip install -e examples/python/llm_embedding_ner
```
To experiment with the provided example, simply execute the main Python script:
```bash
python -m llm_embedding_ner # run the example
```
You can specify your own text using:
```bash
python -m llm_embedding_ner [--text TEXT]
```
If you wish to customize it, explore additional features, or save it use the CLI with the `--help` option for guidance:
```bash
python -m llm_embedding_ner --help
```
