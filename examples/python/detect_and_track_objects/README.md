Another more elaborate example applying simple object detection and segmentation on a video using the Huggingface `transformers` library. Tracking across frames is performed using [CSRT](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.08461.pdf) from OpenCV.

```bash
pip install -r examples/python/detect_and_track_objects/requirements.txt
