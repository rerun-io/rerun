## Background
Mini NVS Solver is a minimal implementation of NVS Solver. This method explores Video Diffusion Models as a Zero-Shot Novel View Synthesizer.
Given a single image, multi-image, or dynamic video and a chosen camera trajectory, NVS Solver can generate the image frames of the camera on said trajectory using stable diffusion video and the warped input views.

## Run the code
This is an external example. Check the [repository](https://github.com/pablovela5620/mini-nvs-solver) for more information.

You can try the example on Rerun's HuggingFace space [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/pablovela5620/mini-nvs-solver)].

Its highly recommended to run this example locally by cloning the above repo and running:
```
pixi run app
```
