## Background

GLOMAP is a general purpose global structure-from-motion pipeline for image-based sparse reconstruction. As compared to COLMAP it provides a much more efficient and scalable reconstruction process, typically 1-2 orders of magnitude faster, with on-par or superior reconstruction quality. In the video we see it's global positioning step where it performs a joint global triangulation and camera position estimation starting from a randomly initialized state.
