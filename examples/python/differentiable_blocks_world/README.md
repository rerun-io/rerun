Finding a textured mesh decomposition from a collection of posed images is a very challenging optimization problem. “Differentiable Block Worlds” by @t_monnier et al. shows impressive results using differentiable rendering. I visualized how this optimization works using the Rerun SDK.

In “Differentiable Blocks World: Qualitative 3D Decomposition by Rendering Primitives” the authors describe an optimization of a background icosphere, a ground plane, and multiple superquadrics. The goal is to find the shapes and textures that best explain the observations.

The optimization is initialized with an initial set of superquadrics (”blocks”), a ground plane, and a sphere for the background. From here, the optimization can only reduce the number of blocks, not add additional ones.

A key difference to other differentiable renderers is the addition of transparency handling. Each mesh has an opacity associated with it that is optimized. When the opacity becomes lower than a threshold the mesh is discarded in the visualization. This allows to optimize the number of meshes.

To stabilize the optimization and avoid local minima, a 3-stage optimization is employed:
1. the texture resolution is reduced by a factor of 8,
2. the full resolution texture is optimized, and
3. transparency-based optimization is deactivated, only optimizing the opaque meshes from here.

Check out the [project page](https://www.tmonnier.com/DBW/), which also contains examples of physical simulation and scene editing enabled by this kind of scene decomposition.

Also make sure to read the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05473) by Tom Monnier, Jake Austin, Angjoo Kanazawa, Alexei A. Efros, Mathieu Aubry. Interesting study of how to approach such a difficult optimization problem.
