By combining MetaAI's [Segment Anything Model (SAM)](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything) and [Multiview Compressive Coding (MCC)](https://github.com/facebookresearch/MCC) we can get a 3D object from a single image.

The basic idea is to use SAM to create a generic object mask so we can exclude the background.

The next step is to generate a depth image. Here we use the awesome [ZoeDepth](https://github.com/isl-org/ZoeDepth) to get realistic depth from the color image.

With depth, color, and an object mask we have everything needed to create a colored point cloud of the object from a single view

MCC encodes the colored points and then creates a reconstruction by sweeping through the volume, querying the network for occupancy and color at each point.

This is a really great example of how a lot of cool solutions are built these days; by stringing together more targeted pre-trained models.The details of the three building blocks can be found in the respective papers:
