    In the Rerun [GitHub](https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun) repository we maintain
    a list of examples that demonstrate using the Rerun logging APIs. Generally the
    examples are individually self-contained, and can be run directly from a Git
    clone of the repository. Many of the Python examples need additional dependencies
    set up in a `requirements.txt` next to the example. These are noted in the
    individual example sections below.

    ## Setup

    Make sure you have the Rerun repository checked out and the latest SDK installed.

    ```bash
    pip install --upgrade rerun-sdk  # install the latest Rerun SDK
    git clone git@github.com:rerun-io/rerun.git  # Clone the repository
    cd rerun
    git checkout latest  # Check out the commit matching the latest SDK release
    ```
    > Note: Make sure your SDK version matches the examples.
    For example, if your SDK version is `0.3.1`, check out the matching tag
    in the Rerun repository by running `git checkout v0.3.1`.

        The following examples illustrate using the Rerun logging SDK with potential real-world (if toy) use cases.
        They all require additional data to be downloaded, so an internet connection is needed at least once.
        The dataset fetching logic is all built into the examples, so no additional steps are needed.
        In some of the examples such as [Stable Diffusion](#stable-diffusion), the algorithm is run on-line,
        and may benefit from a GPU-enabled PyTorch machine.

        The following examples serve to illustrate various uses of the Rerun logging SDK.
        They should not require any additional data downloads, and should run offline.
