The following examples illustrate using the Rerun logging SDK with potential real-world (if toy) use cases.
They all require additional data to be downloaded, so an internet connection is needed at least once.
Each example downloads it's own data, so no additional steps are needed.
For the simplest possible examples showing how to use each api,
check out [Types](/docs/reference/types).

You can try these examples live at <https://app.rerun.io/>.

### Examples with Real / Artificial Data
To run these examples, make sure you have the Rerun repository checked out
and the latest SDK installed.

```bash
pip install --upgrade rerun-sdk  # install the latest Rerun SDK
git clone git@github.com:rerun-io/rerun.git  # Clone the repository
cd rerun
git checkout latest  # Check out the commit matching the latest SDK release
```
> Note: Make sure your SDK version matches the examples.
For example, if your SDK version is `0.3.1`, check out the matching tag
in the Rerun repository by running `git checkout v0.3.1`.

### Paper Visualizations
To reproduce the paper visualizations check out the README of the respective
Rerun forks.
