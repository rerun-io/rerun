### Examples with Real / Artificial Data
To run these examples, make sure you have the Rerun repository checked out
and the latest SDK installed.

```bash
pip install --upgrade rerun-sdk  # install the latest Rerun SDK
git clone git@github.com:rerun-io/rerun.git  # Clone the repository
cd rerun
git checkout latest  # Check out the commit matching the latest SDK release
```
> Note: Make sure your SDK version matches the examples.
For example, if your SDK version is `0.3.1`, check out the matching tag
in the Rerun repository by running `git checkout v0.3.1`.

### Paper Visualizations
To reproduce the paper visualizations check out the README of the respective
Rerun forks.
