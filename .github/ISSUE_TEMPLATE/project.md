<!--
Projects are larger (~2+ person-weeks) pieces of work that have a beginning and an end.
This issue is meant to be used to track a single project through conception to shipped.

A project issue doesn't need to be fully filled out in the beginning of the project but must be at the time of shipping.

Feel free to add any helpful sections to make it as useful as possible to the team running the project and as clear as possible for anyone else. Also feel free to move around sections if you think it fits better.

## Summary description
<!-- A clear and concise (summary) description of what this project is about .-->

## Background and problem
<!-- Describe the background to why we want to do this project and what problem we're trying to solve-->

## Grounding use-cases
<!-- Rerun is both powerful and complex, which makes it easy to go off and solve abstract problems that don't actually provide significant value in any realistic scenarios.

This section should describe the real world use-cases that the project is targeting.

If this project has significant user experience implications,
this section should likely link to some more thorough user research.

NOTE: take care to not put any proprietary user-information here or in any publicly accessible place. Any such information should be properly secured in private locations. Any information that the user's have publicly shared themselves is fine to link to.
-->

## How to describe, demo and evaluate
<!-- This section will vary significantly depending on the type of project.

- How should the output of this project be described (docs, blogpost)?
- How do we best demo the result (new code examples, demo videos, before/after metrics)
- How do we evaluate success (target benchmark, target use-case requires much less code, user interviews)?
-->

## Designs and plans
<!-- Any notes or material on the design and implementation plans -->

## Tasks
<!-- Tasks needed to complete the project -->

- [ ] Simple inline tasks
