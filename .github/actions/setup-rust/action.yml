# This action sets up:
# - The correct version of Rust based on the `rust-toolchain` file
# - All components + targets specified in `rust-toolchain`
# - Caching of dependencies via `Swatinem/rust-cache`
# - Caching of individual compilation requests via `sccache` and GCS
#   - Uses our own `rerun-io/sccache-action` which supports GCS
#
# Note that due to the use of GCS as an sccache storage backend,
# this action also sets up GCP credentials as a side effect.
# There is no harm to setting up the credentials twice accidentally,
# but care should be taken not to do that, as it's wasteful.
