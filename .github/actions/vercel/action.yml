# If `target` is set to `production`, this action handles updating the
# target commit env variable (`RELEASE_COMMIT`) which is used as the
# pointer for `rerun.io/docs` and `rerun.io/examples` and triggering
# a redeploy of `rerun.io`.

# If `target` is set to `preview`, then this instead deploys a fresh preview
# with an override for `release_commit`, and sets the `vercel_preview_url` output.
