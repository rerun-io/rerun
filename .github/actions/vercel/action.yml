# If `target` is set to `production`, this action handles updating the
# target commit env variable (`RELEASE_COMMIT`) which is used as the
# pointer for `rerun.io/docs` and `rerun.io/examples` and triggering
# a redeploy of `rerun.io`.

# If `target` is set to `preview`, then this instead deploys a fresh preview
# with an override for `release_commit`, and sets the following outputs:
# - `vercel_preview_result`
# - `vercel_preview_url`
# - `vercel_preview_inspector_url`

name: "Deploy rerun.io"

# Changing these inputs also requires changing their usage in `index.mjs`
