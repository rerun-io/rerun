# If `target` is set to `production`, this action handles updating the
# target commit env variable (`RELEASE_COMMIT`) which is used as the
# pointer for `rerun.io/docs` and `rerun.io/examples` and triggering
# a redeploy of `rerun.io`.

# If `target` is set to `preview`, then this instead deploys a fresh preview
# with an override for `release_commit`, and sets the following outputs:
# - `vercel_preview_deployment_id`
# - `vercel_preview_url`
# - `vercel_preview_inspector_url`
#
# The `vercel_preview_deployment_id` may be used to wait for the deployment
# to complete with the `wait-for-deployment` command, which outputs:
# - `vercel_preview_result`, either "success" or "failure"
# - `vercel_preview_url`
# - `vercel_preview_inspector_url`
