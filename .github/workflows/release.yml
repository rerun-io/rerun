  # Re-entrancy:
  # - `version` is re-entrant because it doesn't commit/create PR if the version doesn't change,
  #   and the version doesn't change if we're already on the final version specified by the branch name.
  # - `update-docs` is re-entrant because it overwrites history of the `gh-pages` branch, so any
  #   previous partial update will just be overwritten by the next successful run.
  # - `publish-crates` is re-entrant because the `crates.py` script correctly handles publish failures
  #   by first checking if a crate has already been published before attempting to publish it.
  # - `build-and-publish-wheels` is re-entrant because all the uploaded artifacts will be overwritten
  #   by any subsequent runs, and the final upload to PyPI has the `--skip-existing` flag, which ignores
  #   any wheels already uploaded.
  # - `build-and-publish-web` is re-entrant for the same reason as `build-and-publish-wheels`,
  #   except that uploads are done to GCS instead of PyPI.
