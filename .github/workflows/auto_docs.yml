name: Push to docs-latest on merge

# TODO(jan):
# 1. trigger on push to `main`
# 2. if the commit ends with (#\d+), that is the PR number
# 3. find the PR by its number
# 4. if the PR has the label `deploy-docs`, then push the commit
#    to `docs-latest`
# 5. once committed, send a comment to the PR:
#    "`deploy-docs` label found, this PR has been deployed to `docs-latest`."
#    ideally, also include a link to the deploy job on vercel.
