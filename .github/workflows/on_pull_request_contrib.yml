# Jobs that only run for external contributors.
# These have to be carefully sanitized, we don't want to leak secrets.
# - We can't use caching, outside of really rare scenarios, because our caching largely depends on GCS
# - We have to ensure that these jobs _only_ run for PRs outside of the `rerun-io` organization
#   this is done using the following check, added to every job:
#     if: github.event.pull_request.head.repo.owner.login != 'rerun-io'
