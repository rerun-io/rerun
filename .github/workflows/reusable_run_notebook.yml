        # `pip` considers local and remote package with the same version interchangeable.
        # That means we need to set `--no-index` to force it to install the local package,
        # but then it can't find any of the wheel's remote dependencies!
        #
        # The error would look like:
        #   Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement attrs>=23.1.0 (from rerun-sdk) (from versions: none)
        #
        # So instead we do this complicated dance:
        # 1. Install `rerun-sdk` and `rerun-notebook` with `--no-deps --no-index`.
        #      It is guaranteed to install the local wheel because of `--no-index`,
        #      and won't error due to not being able to find dependencies because
        #      of `--no-deps`.
        # 2. Install `rerun-sdk[notebook]` from the wheel again.
        #      This will not reinstall `rerun-sdk` or `rerun-notebook`, but it will
        #      properly install all dependencies.
        # It's a mystery whether or not this installs the dependencies of the local wheel, or of the pypi-published packageâ€¦
