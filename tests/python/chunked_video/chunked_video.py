"""Logs all videos in a folder to a single entity in order."""

# Order is either alphabetical or - if present - by last filename digits parsed as integer.
#
# Any folder of .mp4 files can be used.
# For Rerun internal users, there are examples assets available at
# https://github.com/rerun-io/internal-test-assets/tree/main/video
#
# Things to look out for:
# * are all chunks arriving, are things crashing
# * is the video playing smooth on video asset transitions
# * does seeking across and within video assets work
# * does memory usage induced by mp4 parsing stay low over time and doesn't accumluate (TODO(#7481): it should be smaller to begin with)
