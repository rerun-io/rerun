# Transforms 3D hierarchy

This test adds more and more transforms in a hierarchy on each step on the `steps` timeline.

Enable the origin axis on the view to get a better impression of what happens in the scene.

What you should see on each step on the `steps` timeline:
* 0: There's a Rerun logo is at the origin, the `e` sits roughly above the origin.
* 1: The logo is translated a few units diagonally positively on x/y/z.
* 2: The logo is back to normal (frame 0) again.
* 3: The logo is squished along its height
* 4: The logo is back to normal (frame 0) again.
* 5: The logo rotated 90 degrees around the y axis (green). It reads now along the z axis (blue).
* 6: The logo rotated 45 degrees around the y axis (green).
* 7: The logo is back to normal (frame 0) again.
