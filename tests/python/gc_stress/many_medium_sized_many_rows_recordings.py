"""
Stress test for cross-recording garbage collection.

Logs many medium-sized recordings that contain a lot of small-ish rows.

Usage:
- Start a Rerun Viewer in release mode with 500MiB of memory limit:
  `cargo r -p rerun-cli --release --no-default-features --features native_viewer -- --memory-limit 500MiB`
- Open the memory panel to see what's going on.
- Run this script.
- You should see recordings coming in and going out in a ringbuffer-like rolling fashion.
