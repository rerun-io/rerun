# Writing rules

This document summaries the writing rules regarding the visible text in the UI.

1. If the text string references a coding convention, use the casing that respects the coding convention. E.g. `COLMAP`,  `translate3d` or `InstanceMethod`.
2. Default to `Sentence case like this` for most elements in the UI
3. Rerun concepts are Title Cased: `Space View`, `Selection View`, `Command Palette`,  `Memory Panel`, `Entity`, etc.
4. Only end sentences with a period when there are multiple sentences in the current context. For instance, if a tooltip contains two sentences, both should end with a period. 
5. Never use colons `:` when labeling a UI field.
