[features]
## The default is what the user gets when they call `cargo install rerun-cli --locked`,
## so we have all the bells and wistles here, except those that may require extra tools
## (like "nasm").
## That is: `cargo install rerun-cli --locked` should work for _everyone_.
default = ["native_viewer", "web_viewer", "map_view"]


# !!!IMPORTANT!!!
#
# Do you _really_ want to add features in `release` that are not in `default`?
#
# Here are some reasons not to:
# - These features will be missing from the `cargo install rerun-cli --locked` command our users will inevitably use.
# - These features will not be picked up in places where we cannot use the `release` feature set (e.g. rerun_js).
# - This list is not exhaustive and will unexpectedly grow in the future.
#
# If you insist on adding a feature here, please make sure you address all the concerns above.
#
# `nasm`
# ------
#
# This requires external build tools (the `nasm` cli) and would break any build on a system without it. Mitigation: a
# warning with instructions is printed when building `rerun-cli` in release mode without the `nasm` feature (see
# `build.rs`).

## The features we enable when we build the pre-built binaries during our releases.
## This may enable features that require extra build tools that not everyone has.
release = ["default", "nasm"]


## Support the map view.
## This adds a lot of extra dependencies.
map_view = ["rerun/map_view"]

## Enable faster native video decoding with assembly.
## You need to install [nasm](https://github.com/netwide-assembler/nasm) to compile with this feature.
nasm = ["rerun/nasm"]

## Support spawning a native viewer.
## This adds a lot of extra dependencies, so only enable this feature if you need it!
native_viewer = ["rerun/native_viewer"]

## Enables integration with `re_perf_telemetry` (Tracy, Jaeger).
##
## This only works on native.
perf_telemetry = ["rerun/perf_telemetry"]

## Support serving a web viewer over HTTP.
##
## Enabling this inflates the binary size quite a bit, since it embeds the viewer wasm.
# When building from source (in the repository), this feature adds quite a bit
# to the compile time since it requires compiling and bundling the viewer as wasm.
#
# TODO(#4295): web_viewer shouldn't require rerun/sdk
