//! The core types and traits that power Rerun's data model.
//!
//! The [`Archetype`] trait is the core of this crate and is a good starting point to get familiar
//! with the code.
//! An archetype is a logical collection of batches of [`Component`]s that play well with each other.
//!
//! Rerun (and the underlying Arrow data framework) is designed to work with large arrays of
//! [`Component`]s, as opposed to single instances.
//! When multiple instances of a [`Component`] are put together in an array, they yield a
//! [`ComponentBatch`]: the atomic unit of (de)serialization.
//!
//! Internally, [`Component`]s are implemented using many different [`Datatype`]s.

/// Describes the interface for interpreting an object as a bundle of [`Component`]s.
///
/// ## Custom bundles
///
/// While, in most cases, component bundles are code generated from our [IDL definitions],
/// it is possible to manually extend existing bundles, or even implement fully custom ones.
///
/// All [`AsComponents`] methods are optional to implement, with the exception of
/// [`AsComponents::as_component_batches`], which describes how the bundle can be interpreted
/// as a set of [`ComponentBatch`]es: arrays of components that are ready to be serialized.
///
/// Have a look at our [Custom Data] example to learn more about handwritten bundles.
///
/// [IDL definitions]: https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun/tree/latest/crates/re_types/definitions/rerun
/// [Custom Data]: https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun/blob/latest/examples/rust/custom_data/src/main.rs
