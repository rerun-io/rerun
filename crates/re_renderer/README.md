A custom [wgpu](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/) based renderer tailored towards re_viewer's needs.
Nevertheless, it can be used standalone and comes with its own examples!

Some key features:
* Key primitives for visualization like lines and points are first class citizens
* Built with multiple independent views/cameras in mind
* WebGL compatible quality tier allows use in the browser without WebGPU support
* Hot shader reloading
* â€¦ and more to come!

Goals & philosophy:
* Handle fully dynamic data
  * assumes that most data may change every frame!
* Automatic resource re-use & caching
* Lazy loading whenever possible for best startup performance
* Run great both on the desktop and web
* No dependencies on `re_viewer` or rerun data store libraries
