/// ## Multithreading and ordering
///
/// Internally, all operations are linearized into a pipeline:
/// - All operations sent by a given thread will take effect in the same exact order as that
///   thread originally sent them in, from its point of view.
/// - There isn't any well defined global order across multiple threads.
///
/// This means that e.g. flushing the pipeline (`rr_recording_stream_flush_blocking`) guarantees
/// that all previous data sent by the calling thread has been recorded; no more, no less.
/// (e.g. it does not mean that all file caches are flushed)
///
/// ## Shutdown
///
/// The recording stream can only be shutdown by dropping all instances of it, at which point
/// it will automatically take care of flushing any pending data that might remain in the
/// pipeline.
///
/// TODO(andreas): The only way of having two instances of a `RecordingStream` is currently to
/// set it as a the global.
