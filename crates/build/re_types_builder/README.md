This crate implements Rerun's code generation tools.

These tools translate language-agnostic IDL definitions (flatbuffers) into code.

You can generate the code with `just codegen`.

### Doclinks
The `.fbs` files can contain docstring (`///`) which in turn can contain doclinks.
They are to be written on the form `[archetypes.Image]`.

Only links to types are currently supported.

Link checking is not done by the codegen, but the output is checked implicityly by `cargo doc`, `lychee` etc.

We only support doclinks to the default `rerun.scope`.
