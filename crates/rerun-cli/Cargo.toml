[features]
# The default is what the user gets when they call `cargo install rerun-cli`,
# so wer have all the bells and wistles here
default = ["native_viewer", "web_viewer"]

## Support spawning a native viewer.
## This adds a lot of extra dependencies, so only enable this feature if you need it!
native_viewer = ["rerun/native_viewer"]

## Support serving a web viewer over HTTP.
##
## Enabling this inflates the binary size quite a bit, since it embeds the viewer wasm.
# When building from source (in the repository), this feature adds quite a bit
# to the compile time since it requires compiling and bundling the viewer as wasm.
#
# You also need to install some additional tools, which you can do by running
# [`scripts/setup_web.sh`](https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun/blob/main/scripts/setup_web.sh).
