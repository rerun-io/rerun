In and out of process performance profiling utilities for Rerun & Redap.

Performance telemetry is always disabled by default. It is gated both by a feature flag (`perf_telemetry`) and runtime configuration in the form of environment variables:
* `TELEMETRY_ENABLED`: is performance telemetry enabled at all (default: `false`)?
* `TRACY_ENABLED`: is the tracy integration enabled (default: `false`)? works even if `TELEMETRY_ENABLED=false`, to reduce noise in measurements.
* `OTEL_SDK_ENABLED`: is the OpenTelemetry enabled (default: `false`)? does nothing if `TELEMETRY_ENABLED=false`.


## What

`re_perf_telemetry` is a suite of developer tools that integrate with the `tracing` ecosystem and, by extension, make it possible to use:
* out-of-process IO-focused profilers such as the [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) ecosystem (gRPC, trace propagation, distributed tracing, etc)
* in-process compute-focused profilers such as [Tracy](https://github.com/wolfpld/tracy)

What you can or cannot do with that depends on which project you're working on (Redap, Rerun SDK, Rerun Viewer). See below for more information.


### Redap

If you have source access to the Rerun dataplatform check the Readme there.


### Rerun SDK

In the Rerun SDK, `re_perf_telemetry` is always disabled by default (feature flagged), and only meant as a developer tool: it never ships with the final user builds.

The integration works pretty well for both out-of-process and in-process profiling.

We'll use the following script as an example:
```py
import rerun as rr

client = rr.catalog.CatalogClient("rerun://sandbox.redap.rerun.io")
client.dataset_entries()

dataset = client.get_dataset_entry(name="droid:raw")

# Get the RecordBatch reader from the query view
df = dataset.dataframe_query_view(
    index="real_time",
    contents={"/camera/ext1": ["VideoFrameReference:timestamp"]},
).df()

print(df.count())
```

* Example of out-of-process profiling using Jaeger (run `pixi run compose-dev` in the Redap repository to start a Jaeger instance):
  ```sh
  # Build the SDK with performance telemetry enabled, in the 'examples' environment:
  $ py-build-perf-examples

  # Run your script with both telemetry and the OpenTelemetry integration enabled:
  $ TELEMETRY_ENABLED=true OTEL_SDK_ENABLED=true <your_script>

  # Go to the Jaeger UI (http://localhost:16686/search) to look at the results
  ```

#### Future work

* Integration with [datafusion-tracing](https://github.com/datafusion-contrib/datafusion-tracing)


### Rerun Viewer

In the Rerun Viewer, `re_perf_telemetry` is always disabled by default (feature flagged), and only meant as a developer tool: it never ships with the final user builds.

The integration only really works with in-process profiling, and even then with caveats (see `Limitations` and `Future work` below).

* Example of in-process profiling using Tracy:
  ```sh
  # Start the viewer with both telemetry and the Tracy integration enabled:
  $ TELEMETRY_ENABLED=true TRACY_ENABLED=true pixi run rerun-perf
  ```

  *In this screenshot, I browsed a Redap catalog and then opened one of the recordings. Can you guess when the video decoding happened? üòÅ*


#### Limitations

* `puffin` spans are not forwarded to the perf telemetry tools
  While this is technically do-able (would require adding a `tracing` integration to the `puffin` crate itself), our `puffin` spans were not implemented with the kind of overhead that the `tracing` involves in mind anyway.
  A possible future approach would be a native Tracy integration for the Viewer, see `Future work` below.

* The viewer will crash during shutdown when perf telemetry is enabled
  This is actually unrelated to `re_perf_telemetry` AFAICT: the viewer will crash on exit because of what appears to be a design flaw in `tracing-subscriber`'s shutdown implementation, specifically it assumes that all the relevant thread-local state will be dropped in the proper order, when really it won't and there's no way to guarantee that. See <https://github.com/tokio-rs/tracing/issues/3239>.
  Since this is a very niche feature only meant to be used for deep performance work, I think this is fine for now (and I don't think there's anything we can do from userspace anyhow, this is a pure `tracing` vs. Rust's TLS implementation issue).


#### Future work

The Rerun Viewer would greatly benefit from a _native_ Tracy integration (i.e. using the Tracy client directly, instead of going through the `tracing` ecosystem).

This would not only alleviate the overhead of the `tracing` ecosystem, it would also make it possible to use all the more advanced features of Tracy in the viewer (e.g. GPU spans, framebuffer previews, allocation tracing, contention spans, plots, sub-frames, etc).
Check out this [web demo](https://tracy.nereid.pl/) for a taste of what a native Tracy integration can do.
