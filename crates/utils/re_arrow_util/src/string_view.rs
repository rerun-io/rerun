/// Heuristically compact `StringViewArray`s to reduce memory usage, if needed
///
/// Decides when to consolidate the `StringView` into a new buffer to reduce
/// memory usage and improve string locality for better performance.
///
/// This differs from `StringViewArray::gc` because:
/// 1. It may not compact the array depending on a heuristic.
/// 2. It uses a precise block size to reduce the number of buffers to track.
///
/// # Heuristic
///
/// If the average size of each view is larger than 32 bytes, we compact the array.
///
/// `StringViewArray` include pointers to buffer that hold the underlying data.
/// One of the great benefits of `StringViewArray` is that many operations
/// (e.g., `filter`) can be done without copying the underlying data.
///
/// However, after a while (e.g., after `FilterExec` or `HashJoinExec`) the
/// `StringViewArray` may only refer to a small portion of the buffer,
/// significantly increasing memory usage.
///
/// See apache/datafusion#11667 for the historical basis of this code.
