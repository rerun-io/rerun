/// Trait for parsing MCAP messages of a specific schema into Rerun chunks.
///
/// This trait defines the interface for converting MCAP messages into Rerun's internal
/// chunk format. Implementations handle the incremental processing of messages and
/// eventual conversion to structured data that can be visualized in Rerun.
///
/// ### Message Parsing
///
/// The parsing process follows a two-phase approach:
///
/// 1. Process messages incrementally via [`append()`](`Self::append`),
///    where parsers can extract and accumulate data from each message.
/// 2. All accumulated data is converted into [`Chunk`]s via
///    [`finalize()`](`Self::finalize`), which consumes the parser and returns the final Rerun chunks.
pub trait MessageParser {
    /// Process a single MCAP message and accumulate its data.
    ///
    /// This method is called for each message in the MCAP file that belongs to the
    /// associated channel/schema.
    ///
    /// Implementations should:
    ///
    /// 1. Decode the message data according to the schema
    /// 2. Extract any _additional_ timestamp information and add it to the [`ParserContext`].
    ///    Note: `log_time` and `publish_time` are added automatically.
    /// 3. Accumulate the decoded data for later conversion to Rerun [`Chunk`]s in [`finalize()`](`Self::finalize`).
    fn append(&mut self, ctx: &mut ParserContext, msg: &mcap::Message<'_>) -> anyhow::Result<()>;

    /// Consume the parser and convert all accumulated data into Rerun chunks.
    ///
    /// This method is called after all messages have been processed via [`append()`](`Self::append`).
    /// It should convert the accumulated data into one or more [`Chunk`]s.
    fn finalize(self: Box<Self>, ctx: ParserContext) -> anyhow::Result<Vec<Chunk>>;
