/// A [`DataLoader`] loads data from a file path and/or a file's contents.
///
/// Files can be loaded in 3 different ways:
/// - via the Rerun CLI (`rerun myfile.jpeg`),
/// - using drag-and-drop,
/// - using the open dialog in the Rerun Viewer.
///
/// All these file loading methods support loading a single file, many files at once, or even
/// folders.
/// ⚠ Drag-and-drop of folders does not yet work on the web version of Rerun Viewer ⚠
///
/// We only support loading files from the local filesystem at the moment, and consequently only
/// accept filepaths as input.
/// [There are plans to make this generic over any URI](https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun/issues/4525).
///
/// Rerun comes with a few [`DataLoader`]s by default:
/// - [`RrdLoader`] for [Rerun files],
/// - [`ArchetypeLoader`] for:
///     - [3D models]
///     - [Images]
///     - [Text files]
///
/// ## Execution
///
/// **All** registered [`DataLoader`]s get called when a user tries to open a file, unconditionally.
/// This gives [`DataLoader`]s maximum flexibility to decide what files they are interested in, as
/// opposed to e.g. only being able to look at files' extensions.
///
/// On native, [`DataLoader`]s are executed in parallel.
///
/// [Rerun extensions]: crate::SUPPORTED_RERUN_EXTENSIONS
/// [3D models]: crate::SUPPORTED_MESH_EXTENSIONS
/// [Images]: crate::SUPPORTED_IMAGE_EXTENSIONS
/// [Text files]: crate::SUPPORTED_TEXT_EXTENSIONS
//
// TODO(#4525): `DataLoader`s should support arbitrary URIs
// TODO(#4526): `DataLoader`s should be exposed to the SDKs
