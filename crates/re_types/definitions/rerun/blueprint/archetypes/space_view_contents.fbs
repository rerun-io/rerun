/// The contents of a `SpaceView`.

/// The contents are found by combining a collection of `QueryExpression`s.

/// ```diff
/// + /world/**           # add everything…
/// - /world/roads/**     # …but remove all roads…
/// + /world/roads/main   # …but show main road
/// ```
///
/// If there is multiple matching rules, the most specific rule wins.
/// If there are multiple rules of the same specificity, the last one wins.
/// If no rules match, the path is excluded.
///
/// Specifying a path without a `+` or `-` prefix is equivalent to `+`:
/// ```diff
/// /world/**           # add everything…
/// - /world/roads/**   # …but remove all roads…
/// /world/roads/main   # …but show main road
/// ```
///
/// The `/**` suffix matches the whole subtree, i.e. self and any child, recursively
/// (`/world/**` matches both `/world` and `/world/car/driver`).
/// Other uses of `*` are not (yet) supported.
///
/// Internally, `EntityPathFilter` sorts the rule by entity path, with recursive coming before non-recursive.
/// This means the last matching rule is also the most specific one. For instance:
/// ```diff
/// + /world/**
/// - /world
/// - /world/car/**
/// + /world/car/driver
/// ```
///
/// The last rule matching `/world/car/driver` is `+ /world/car/driver`, so it is included.
/// The last rule matching `/world/car/hood` is `- /world/car/**`, so it is excluded.
/// The last rule matching `/world` is `- /world`, so it is excluded.
/// The last rule matching `/world/house` is `+ /world/**`, so it is included.
