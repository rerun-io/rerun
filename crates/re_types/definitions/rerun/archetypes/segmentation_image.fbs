/// The shape of the `TensorData` must be mappable to an `HxW` tensor.
/// Each pixel corresponds to a class-id that will be mapped to a color based on annotation context.

/// In the case of floating point images, the label will be looked up based on rounding to the nearest
/// integer value.
///
/// Leading and trailing unit-dimensions are ignored, so that
/// `1x640x480x1` is treated as a `640x480` image.

/// \py See also [`AnnotationContext`][rerun.archetypes.AnnotationContext] to associate each class with a color and a label.
/// \rs See also [`AnnotationContext`][crate::archetypes::AnnotationContext] to associate each class with a color and a label.

/// \cpp Since the underlying `rerun::datatypes::TensorData` uses `rerun::Collection` internally,
/// \cpp data can be passed in without a copy from raw pointers or by reference from `std::vector`/`std::array`/c-arrays.
/// \cpp If needed, this "borrow-behavior" can be extended by defining your own `rerun::CollectionAdapter`.
