/// Empties all the components of an entity.

/// The presence of a clear means that a latest-at query of components at a given path(s)
/// will not return any components that were logged at those paths before the clear.
/// Any logged components after the clear are unaffected by the clear.
///
/// This implies that a range query that includes time points that are before the clear,
/// still returns all components at the given path(s), except those logged directly before the clear.
/// Meaning that in practice clears are ineffective for time series plots and other usages of visible time ranges.
