/// The shape of the `TensorData` must be mappable to:
/// - A `HxW` tensor, treated as a grayscale image.
/// - A `HxWx3` tensor, treated as an RGB image.
/// - A `HxWx4` tensor, treated as an RGBA image.
///
/// Leading and trailing unit-dimensions are ignored, so that
/// `1x640x480x3x1` is treated as a `640x480x3` RGB image.
///
/// Rerun also supports compressed image encoded as JPEG, N12, and YUY2.
/// Using these formats can save a lot of bandwidth and memory.
/// \py To compress an image, use [`rerun.Image.compress`][].
/// \py To pass in an already encoded image, use  [`rerun.ImageEncoded`][].
/// \rs See [`crate::components::TensorData`] for more.
/// \cpp See [`rerun::datatypes::TensorBuffer`] for more.
///
/// \cpp Since the underlying `rerun::datatypes::TensorData` uses `rerun::Collection` internally,
/// \cpp data can be passed in without a copy from raw pointers or by reference from `std::vector`/`std::array`/c-arrays.
/// \cpp If needed, this "borrow-behavior" can be extended by defining your own `rerun::CollectionAdapter`.
