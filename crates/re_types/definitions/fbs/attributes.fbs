/// Mandatory attribute that applies to all kinds of objects: structs, enums, unions and even the
/// fields within.
///
/// This defines a stable order between objects of the same kind, e.g. the order in which fields of a
/// struct should be laid out when generating code.
/// This is always required since flatbuffers works entirely with unordered maps internally, which
/// would results in flaky code generation.
///
/// In unions, this effectively defines the arrow tag of each variant, since the tag depends on the
/// fields's order in the datatype!
///
/// NOTE: We do not use flatbuffers' builtin `id` attribute as it only works on `table`s, whereas we
/// need a stable order for all kinds of things.
