//! The standard Rerun data types, component types, and archetypes.
//!
//! This crate contains both the IDL definitions for Rerun types (flatbuffers) as well as the code
//! generated from those using `re_types_builder`.
//!
//! The [`Archetype`] trait is the core of this crate and is a good starting point to get familiar
//! with the code.
//! An archetype is a logical collection of [`Component`]s that play well with each other.
//!
//! Rerun (and the underlying Arrow data framework) is designed to work with large arrays of
//! [`Component`]s, as opposed to single instances.
//! When multiple instances of a [`Component`] are put together in an array, they yield a
//! [`ComponentBatch`]: the atomic unit of (de)serialization.
//!
//! Internally, [`Component`]s are implemented using many different [`Datatype`]s.
//!
//! All builtin archetypes, components and datatypes can be found in their respective top-level
//! modules.
//!
//! ## Contributing
//!
//! ### Organization
//!
//! - `definitions/` contains IDL definitions for all Rerun types (data, components, archetypes).
//! - `src/` contains the code generated for Rust.
//! - `rerun_py/rerun/rerun2/` (at the root of this workspace) contains the code generated for Python.
//!
//! While most of the code in this crate is auto-generated, some manual extensions are littered
//! throughout: look for files ending in `_ext.rs`, `_ext.py`, or `_ext.cpp` (also see the "Extensions"
//! section of this document).
//!
//!
//! ### Build cache
//!
//! Updating either the source code of the code generator itself (`re_types_builder`) or any of the
//! .fbs files should re-trigger the code generation process the next time `re_types` is built.
//! Manual extension files will be left untouched.
//!
//! Caching is controlled by a versioning hash that is stored in `store_hash.txt`.
//! If you suspect something is wrong with the caching mechanism and that your changes aren't taken
//! into account when they should, try and remove `source_hash.txt`.
//! If that fixes the issue, you've found a bug.
//!
//!
//! ### How-to: add a new datatype/component/archetype
//!
//! Create the appropriate .fbs file in the appropriate place, and make sure it gets included in
//! some way (most likely indirectly) by `archetypes.fbs`, which is the main entrypoint for
//! codegen.
//! Generally, the easiest thing to do is to add your new type to one of the centralized manifests,
//! e.g. for a new component, include it into `components.fbs`.
//!
//! Your file should get picked up automatically by the code generator.
//! Once the code for your new component has been generated, implement whatever extensions you need
//! and make sure to tests any custom constructors you add.
//!
//!
//! ### How-to: remove an existing datatype/component/archetype
//!
//! Simply get rid of the type in question and rebuild `re_types` to trigger codegen.
//!
//! Beware though: if you remove a whole definition file re-running codegen will not remove the
//! associated generated files, you'll have to do that yourself.
//!
//!
//! ### Extensions
//!
//!
//! #### Rust
//!
//! Generated Rust code can be manually extended by adding sibling files with the `_ext.rs`
//! prefix. E.g. to extend `vec2d.rs`, create a `vec2d_ext.rs`.
//!
//! Trigger the codegen (e.g. by removing `source_hash.txt`) to generate the right `mod` clauses
//! automatically.
//!
//! The simplest way to get started is to look at any of the existing examples.
//!
//!
//! #### Python
//!
//! Generated Python code can be manually extended by adding a sibling file with the `_ext.py`
//! prefix. E.g. to extend `vec2d.py`, create a `vec2d_ext.py`.
//!
//! This sibling file needs to implement an extension class that is mixed in with the
//! auto-generated class.
//! The simplest way to get started is to look at any of the existing examples.
//!
//!
//! #### C++
//!
//! Generated C++ code can be manually extended by adding a sibling file with the `_ext.cpp` suffix.
//! E.g. to extend `vec2d.cpp`, create a `vec2d_ext.cpp`.
//!
//! The sibling file is compiled as-is as part of the `rerun_cpp` crate.
//!
//! Any include directive used in the extension is automatically added to the generated header,
//! except to the generated header itself.
//!
//! In order to extend the generated type declaration in the header,
//! you can specify a single code-block that you want to be injected into the type declaration by
//! starting it with `[CODEGEN COPY TO HEADER START]` and ending it with `[CODEGEN COPY TO HEADER END]`.
//! Note that it is your responsibility to make sure that the cpp file is valid C++ code -
//! the code generator & build will not adjust the extension file for you!
//!
