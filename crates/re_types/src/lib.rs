//! The standard Rerun data types, component types, and archetypes.
//!
//! This crate contains both the IDL definitions for Rerun types (flatbuffers) as well as the code
//! generated from those using `re_types_builder`.
//!
//! All builtin archetypes, components and datatypes can be found in their respective top-level
//! modules.
//!
//! ## Contributing
//!
//! ### Organization
//!
//! - `definitions/` contains IDL definitions for all Rerun types (data, components, archetypes).
//! - `src/` contains the code generated for Rust.
//! - `rerun_py/rerun/rerun2/` (at the root of this workspace) contains the code generated for Python.
//!
//! While most of the code in this crate is auto-generated, some manual extensions are littered
//! throughout: look for files ending in `_ext.rs`, `_ext.py`, or `_ext.cpp` (also see the "Extensions"
//! section of this document).
//!
//!
//! ### Build cache
//!
//! Updating either the source code of the code generator itself (`re_types_builder`) or any of the
//! .fbs files should re-trigger the code generation process the next time `re_types` is built.
//! Manual extension files will be left untouched.
//!
//! Caching is controlled by a versioning hash that is stored in `store_hash.txt`.
//! If you suspect something is wrong with the caching mechanism and that your changes aren't taken
//! into account when they should, try and remove `source_hash.txt`.
//! If that fixes the issue, you've found a bug.
//!
//!
//! ### How-to: add a new datatype/component/archetype
//!
//! Create the appropriate .fbs file in the appropriate place, and make sure it gets included in
//! some way (most likely indirectly) by `archetypes.fbs`, which is the main entrypoint for
//! codegen.
//! Generally, the easiest thing to do is to add your new type to one of the centralized manifests,
//! e.g. for a new component, include it into `components.fbs`.
//!
//! Your file should get picked up automatically by the code generator.
//! Once the code for your new component has been generated, implement whatever extensions you need
//! and make sure to tests any custom constructors you add.
//!
//!
//! ### How-to: remove an existing datatype/component/archetype
//!
//! Simply get rid of the type in question and rebuild `re_types` to trigger codegen.
//!
//! Beware though: if you remove a whole definition file re-running codegen will not remove the
//! associated generated files, you'll have to do that yourself.
//!
//!
//! ### Extensions
//!
//!
//! #### Rust
//!
//! Generated Rust code can be manually extended by adding sibling files with the `_ext.rs`
//! prefix. E.g. to extend `vec2d.rs`, create a `vec2d_ext.rs`.
//!
//! Trigger the codegen (e.g. by removing `source_hash.txt`) to generate the right `mod` clauses
//! automatically.
//!
//! The simplest way to get started is to look at any of the existing examples.
//!
//!
//! #### Python
//!
//! Generated Python code can be manually extended by adding a sibling file with the `_ext.py`
//! prefix. E.g. to extend `vec2d.py`, create a `vec2d_ext.py`.
//!
//! This sibling file needs to implement an extension class that is mixed in with the
//! auto-generated class.
//! The simplest way to get started is to look at any of the existing examples.
//!
//!
//! #### C++
//!
//! Generated C++ code can be manually extended by adding a sibling file with the `_ext.cpp` suffix.
//! E.g. to extend `vec2d.cpp`, create a `vec2d_ext.cpp`.
//!
//! The sibling file is compiled as-is as part of the `rerun_cpp` crate.
//!
//! Any include directive used in the extension is automatically added to the generated header,
//! except to the generated header itself.
//!
//! In order to extend the generated type declaration in the header,
//! you can specify a single code-block that you want to be injected into the type declaration by
//! starting it with `<CODEGEN_COPY_TO_HEADER>` and ending it with `</CODEGEN_COPY_TO_HEADER>`.
//! Note that it is your responsibility to make sure that the cpp file is valid C++ code -
//! the code generator & build will not adjust the extension file for you!
//!
//! ### Language-specific documentation
//!
//! You can prefix any doc comment line with `\{tag}`, where `{tag}` is one of `py`, `cpp`, `rs`,
//! and that part of the docs will only be present in the files generated for that specific
//! language.
//!
//! ### Examples
//!
//! You can add an example to `docs/snippets/all`, and then include its source code in
//! the docs using the `\example` tag. The example will also be included in the list of
//! examples for type's generated docs.
//!
//! The `\example` tag supports the following arguments:
//! - `title`: a short description of the example which will be shown before the source code
//! - `image`: a link to an image, with special handling for images uploaded
//!            using `scripts/upload_image.py` to `static.rerun.io`
//! - `!api`: if present, the example will *not* be included in comments embedded in the generated code
//!
//! ```text,ignore
//! \example example_file_name title="Some title" image="https://link.to/any_image.png"
//! ```
//!
//! If the url does not start with `https://static.rerun.io/`, then it will be used as the
//! `src` attribute in an `img` HTML tag, without any changes:
//! ```html,ignore
//! <img src="https://link.to/any_image.png">
//! ```
//!
//! Otherwise the URL is treated as a rerun screenshot, which expects the following link format:
//! ```text,ignore
//! https://static.rerun.io/{name}/{hash}/{max_width}.{ext}
//! ```
//!
//! These parameters will be used to generate an image stack:
//! - `name`: the original filename of the uploaded screenshot, without its extension
//! - `hash`: the content hash of the original screenshot
//! - `max_width`: the maximum width available for this screenshot.
//!   - If the value is not a valid integer suffixed by `w` (e.g. `1200w`), then the image stack will only include the `full` size.
//!   - If the value _is_ a valid integer, then sizes _larger_ than the value will be omitted from the stack.
//! - `ext`: the file extension of the image (`png`, `jpeg`, etc.)
//!
//! Given a URL like `https://static.rerun.io/my_screenshot/9066060e59ee9d2d7d98b214b8db0b8f2e8ab4b8/1024w.png`,
//! the docs codegen will generate the following image stack:
//! ```html,ignore
//! <picture>
//!   <source media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="https://static.rerun.io/my_screenshot/9066060e59ee9d2d7d98b214b8db0b8f2e8ab4b8/480w.png">
//!   <source media="(max-width: 768px)" srcset="https://static.rerun.io/my_screenshot/9066060e59ee9d2d7d98b214b8db0b8f2e8ab4b8/768w.png">
//!   <source media="(max-width: 1024px)" srcset="https://static.rerun.io/my_screenshot/9066060e59ee9d2d7d98b214b8db0b8f2e8ab4b8/1024w.png">
//!   <img src="https://static.rerun.io/my_screenshot/9066060e59ee9d2d7d98b214b8db0b8f2e8ab4b8/full.png" alt="screenshot of {title} example">
//! </picture>
//! ```
//! The `1200px` size was omitted from the stack.
//!
//! #### How to use this with `scripts/upload_image.py`
//!
//! Running `scripts/upload_image.py {file}` will generate an image stack.
//! You need to take the _maximum width_ available in that stack, and use it as the value of `image=` in `\example`.
//!
//! For example, if the image stack generated by the script is:
//! ```html,ignore
//! <picture>
//!   <source media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="https://static.rerun.io/my_screenshot/9066060e59ee9d2d7d98b214b8db0b8f2e8ab4b8/480w.png">
//!   <source media="(max-width: 768px)" srcset="https://static.rerun.io/my_screenshot/9066060e59ee9d2d7d98b214b8db0b8f2e8ab4b8/768w.png">
//!   <source media="(max-width: 1024px)" srcset="https://static.rerun.io/my_screenshot/9066060e59ee9d2d7d98b214b8db0b8f2e8ab4b8/1024w.png">
//!   <img src="https://static.rerun.io/my_screenshot/9066060e59ee9d2d7d98b214b8db0b8f2e8ab4b8/full.png">
//! </picture>
//! ```
//! Then the url you should use is `https://static.rerun.io/my_screenshot/9066060e59ee9d2d7d98b214b8db0b8f2e8ab4b8/1024w.png`.
//!
//! It works this way because `upload_image.py` does not upscale screenshots, it only downscales them.
//! We need to know what the maximum width we can use is, because we can't just provide all the widths all the time.
//! If the currently-used `max-width` source fails to load, it will show the blank image icon.
//! There is no way to provide a fallback in `<picture>` if a specific `max-width` source fails to load.
//! Browsers will not automatically try to load the other sources!
