/// An archetype is a high-level construct that represents a set of [`Component`]s that usually
/// play well with each other (i.e. they compose nicely).
///
/// Internally, it is no different than a collection of components, but working at that higher
/// layer of abstraction opens opportunities for nicer APIs & tools that wouldn't be possible
/// otherwise.
///
/// E.g. consider the [`crate::archetypes::Points3D`] archetype, which represents the set of
/// components to consider when working with a 3D point cloud within Rerun.
///
/// ## Custom Archetypes
///
/// While, in most cases, archetypes are code generated from our [IDL definitions], it is possible to
/// manually extend existing archetypes, or even implement fully custom ones.
///
/// Most [`Archetype`] methods are optional to implement.
/// The most important method to implement is [`Archetype::as_component_lists`], which describes how
/// the archetype can be interpreted as a [`ComponentList`]: a set of components that are ready to
/// be serialized.
///
/// Have a look at our [Custom Data] example to learn more about handwritten archetypes.
///
/// [IDL definitions]: https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun/tree/latest/crates/re_types/definitions/rerun
