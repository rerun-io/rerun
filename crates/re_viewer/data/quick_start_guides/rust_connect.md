# Rust Quick Start

## Installing Rerun

To use the Rerun SDK in your project, you need the [rerun crate](https://crates.io/crates/rerun) which you can add with `cargo add rerun`.

Let's try it out in a brand-new Rust project:

```sh
cargo init cube && cd cube && cargo add rerun --features native_viewer
```

Note that the Rerun SDK requires a working installation of Rust 1.74+.

## Logging your own data

Add the following code to your `main.rs` file:

```rust
${EXAMPLE_CODE}
```

You can now run your application:

```shell
cargo run
```

Once everything finishes compiling, you will see the points in this viewer:
