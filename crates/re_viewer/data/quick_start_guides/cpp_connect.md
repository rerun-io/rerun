## C++ Quick Start

${SAFARI_WARNING}

#### Installing the Rerun viewer
The Rerun C++ SDK works by connecting to an awaiting Rerun Viewer over TCP.

Building from source:
* [Install cargo](https://rustup.rs/)
* `cargo install rerun-cli`

Using `pip`:
* `pip install rerun-sdk`

After you have installed it, type `rerun` in your terminal to start the viewer.


#### Using the Rerun C++ SDK with CMake
```cmake
include(FetchContent)
FetchContent_Declare(rerun_sdk URL
    https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun/releases/latest/download/rerun_cpp_sdk.zip)
FetchContent_MakeAvailable(rerun_sdk)
```

This will download a bundle with pre-built Rerun C static libraries for most desktop platforms,
all Rerun C++ sources and headers, as well as CMake build instructions for them.
By default this will in turn download & build [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/)'s C++ library which is required to build the Rerun C++.
See [Install arrow-cpp](https://www.rerun.io/docs/howto/arrow-cpp-install?speculative-link) to learn more about this step and how to use an existing install.

Make sure you link with `rerun_sdk`:
```cmake
target_link_libraries(your_executable PRIVATE rerun_sdk)
```

##### Logging your own data

Put the following code to your `main.cpp`:

```cpp
${EXAMPLE_CODE}
```

Start the rerun viewer (`rerun`) and then build and run your C++ program.

You should see the points in this viewer:
