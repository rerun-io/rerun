# Rust quick start

## Installing Rerun

After you have [installed the viewer](https://www.rerun.io/docs/getting-started/installing-viewer) you can simply add [the rerun crate](https://crates.io/crates/rerun) to your project with `cargo add rerun`.

Let's try it out in a brand-new Rust project:

```sh
cargo init cube && cd cube && cargo add rerun
```

Note that the Rerun SDK requires a working installation of Rust 1.74+.

## Logging your own data

Add the following code to your `main.rs` file:

```rust
${EXAMPLE_CODE_RUST_SPAWN}
```

You can now run your application:

```shell
cargo run
```

Once everything finishes compiling, a new viewer will start displaying these points:
