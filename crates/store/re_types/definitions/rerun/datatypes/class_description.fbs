/// The description of a semantic Class.

/// If an entity is annotated with a corresponding [components.ClassId], Rerun will use
/// the attached [datatypes.AnnotationInfo] to derive labels and colors.
///
/// Keypoints within an annotation class can similarly be annotated with a
/// [components.KeypointId] in which case we should defer to the label and color for the
/// [datatypes.AnnotationInfo] specifically associated with the Keypoint.
///
/// Keypoints within the class can also be decorated with skeletal edges.
/// Keypoint-connections are pairs of [components.KeypointId]s. If an edge is
/// defined, and both keypoints exist within the instance of the class, then the
/// keypoints should be connected with an edge. The edge should be labeled and
/// colored as described by the class's [datatypes.AnnotationInfo].
///
/// \py Note that a `ClassDescription` can be directly logged using `rerun.log`.
/// \py This is equivalent to logging a `rerun.AnnotationContext` containing
/// \py a single `ClassDescription`.
