/// For transforms that are propagated in the transform hierarchy, see [archetypes.Transform3D].
///
/// If both [archetypes.LeafTransforms3D] and [archetypes.Transform3D] are present,
/// first the tree propagating [archetypes.Transform3D] is applied, then [archetypes.LeafTransforms3D].
///
/// Currently, most visualizers support only a single leaf transform per entity.
/// Check archetype documentations for details - if not otherwise specified, only the first leaf transform is applied.
///
/// From the point of view of the entity's coordinate system,
/// all components are applied in the inverse order they are listed here.
/// E.g. if both a translation and a max3x3 transform are present,
/// the 3x3 matrix is applied first, followed by the translation.
