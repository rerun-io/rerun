/// Capsules are defined by two endpoints (the centers of their end cap spheres), which are located
/// at (0, 0, 0) and (0, 0, length), that is, extending along the positive direction of the Z axis.
/// Capsules in other orientations may be produced by applying a rotation to the entity or
/// instances.

// TODO(#1361): This archetype should eventually generalize to cylinders without caps, truncated
// cones, and tapered capsules -- all common shapes based on expanding a line segment circularly.
