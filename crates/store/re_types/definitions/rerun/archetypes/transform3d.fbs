/// A transform between two 3D spaces, i.e. a pose.
///
/// From the point of view of the entity's coordinate system,
/// all components are applied in the inverse order they are listed here.
/// E.g. if both a translation and a max3x3 transform are present,
/// the 3x3 matrix is applied first, followed by the translation.
///
/// Whenever you log this archetype, it will write all components, even if you do not explicitly set them.
/// This means that if you first log a transform with only a translation, and then log one with only a rotation,
/// it will be resolved to a transform with only a rotation.
///
/// For transforms that affect only a single entity and do not propagate along the entity tree refer to [archetypes.InstancePoses3D].
