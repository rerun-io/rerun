/// One or more transforms between the current entity and its parent. Unlike [archetypes.Transform3D], it is *not* propagated in the transform hierarchy.
///
/// If both [archetypes.InstancePoses3D] and [archetypes.Transform3D] are present,
/// first the tree propagating [archetypes.Transform3D] is applied, then [archetypes.InstancePoses3D].
///
/// From the point of view of the entity's coordinate system,
/// all components are applied in the inverse order they are listed here.
/// E.g. if both a translation and a max3x3 transform are present,
/// the 3x3 matrix is applied first, followed by the translation.
///
/// Currently, many visualizers support only a single instance transform per entity.
/// Check archetype documentations for details - if not otherwise specified, only the first instance transform is applied.
/// Some visualizers like the mesh visualizer used for [`archetype.Mesh3D`],
/// will draw an object for every pose, a behavior also known as "instancing".
