/// Empties all the components of an entity.

/// The presence of a clear means that a latest-at query of components at a given path(s)
/// will not return any components that were logged at those paths before the clear.
/// Any logged components after the clear are unaffected by the clear.
///
/// This implies that a range query that includes time points that are before the clear,
/// still returns all components at the given path(s).
/// Meaning that in practice clears are ineffective when making use of visible time ranges.
/// Scalar plots are an exception: they track clears and use them to represent holes in the
/// data (i.e. discontinuous lines).
