// Rationale behind the present data modelling:
// - Avoid using `union` at all cost.
// - An explicit "mode" enum maps well with a UI toggle and API parameter, and enabled a hard disambiguation when
//   settings are present for both the latest-at and range modes.
// - Timestamps are hard-invalidated by a change of timeline. So we keep them on a per-timeline basis.

// TODO(#7067): add visible components (maybe in another archetype?)
// TODO(#7072): add (optional) PoV components
// Note: component list should be modelled as:
//     component PovComponents {
//        datatype ComponentNames {
//            value: [string];
//        }
//     }
//
// Motivation:
// - Chances are high that the user prefers to have their pov components _not_ invalidated by a changeof timeline.
// - That is even though a component might _technically_ be soft-invalidated by a change of timeline (e.g. if it was
//   not logged on that particular timeline). But we have to deal regardless with potentially invalid component, so this
//   doesn't change the story much.
