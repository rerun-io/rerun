    /// Examples of what this means:
    ///
    /// * An [archetypes.Ellipsoids3D] will draw three axis-aligned ellipses that are cross-sections
    ///   of each ellipsoid, each of which displays two out of three of the sizes of the ellipsoid.
    /// * For [archetypes.Boxes3D], it is the edges of the box, identical to `DenseWireframe`.
    MajorWireframe (default),

    /// Many lines are drawn to represent the surface of the shape in a see-through fashion.
    ///
    /// Examples of what this means:
    ///
    /// * An [archetypes.Ellipsoids3D] will draw a wireframe triangle mesh that approximates each
    ///   ellipsoid.
    /// * For [archetypes.Boxes3D], it is the edges of the box, identical to `MajorWireframe`.
    DenseWireframe,

    /// The surface of the shape is filled in with a solid color. No lines are drawn.
