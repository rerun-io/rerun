Rerun's spatial transform processing.

Responsible for collecting Rerun compliant spatial transform data & processing them for higher level transform related queries.
This crate encapsulates a lot of the rules underpinning transform related datastructures defined in `re_types`.

Maintains time dependent topological data structures that allow resolving affine transformations between different transform frames (points of reference).

The name is borrowed from ROS's popular [`tf`](https://wiki.ros.org/tf) package as it plays a similar role.
