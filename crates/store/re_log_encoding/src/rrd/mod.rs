//! Everything needed to encode/decode and serialize/deserialize RRD streams.
//!
//! ⚠️Make sure to familiarize yourself with the [crate-level docs](crate) first. ⚠️
//!
//! RRD streams are used everywhere gRPC isn't: files, standard I/O, HTTP fetches, data-loaders, etc.
//! This module is completely unrelated to the Rerun Data Protocol (Redap) gRPC API.
//! This module is also completely unrelated to the legacy SDK comms gRPC API.
//!
//! ## [`Encodable`]/[`Decodable`] vs. `Encoder`/`Decoder`
//!
//! The [`Encodable`]/[`Decodable`] traits specify how transport-level types should be encoded to
//! and decoded from top-level RRD types, respectively. Only transport-level types can be encoded/decoded.
//!
//! That is all these traits do. They do not perform any kind of IO, they do not keep track of any
//! sort of state. That's the job of the `Encoder` and `Decoder`: they provide the IO and the
//! state machines that turn collections of `Encodable`s and `Decodable`s into actual RRD streams.
