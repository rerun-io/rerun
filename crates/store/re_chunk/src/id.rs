/// A unique ID for a [`crate::Chunk`].
///
/// `Chunk`s are the atomic unit of ingestion, transport, storage, events and GC in Rerun.
///
/// Internally, a [`crate::Chunk`] is made up of rows, which are themselves uniquely identified by
/// their [`RowId`].
///
/// There is no relationship whatsoever between a [`ChunkId`] and the [`RowId`]s within that chunk.
///
/// ### Uniqueness
///
/// [`ChunkId`] are assumed unique within a single Recording.
///
/// The chunk store will treat two chunks with the same [`ChunkId`] as the same, and only keep one
/// of them (which one is kept is an arbitrary and unstable implementation detail).
///
/// This makes it easy to build and maintain secondary indices around [`RowId`]s with few to no
/// extraneous state tracking.
///
/// ### Garbage collection
///
/// Garbage collection is handled at the chunk level by first ordering the chunks based on the minimum
/// [`RowId`] present in each of them.
/// Garbage collection therefore happens (roughly) in the logger's wall-clock order.
///
/// This has very important implications when inserting data far into the past or into the future:
/// think carefully about your `RowId`s in these cases.

///
/// There is no relationship whatsoever between a [`ChunkId`] and the [`RowId`]s within that chunk.
///
/// ### Uniqueness
///
/// Duplicated [`RowId`]s within a single recording is considered undefined behavior.
///
/// While it is benign in most cases, care has to be taken when manually crafting [`RowId`]s.
/// Ideally: don't do so and stick to [`RowId::new`] instead to avoid bad surprises.
///
/// This makes it easy to build and maintain secondary indices around [`RowId`]s with few to no
/// extraneous state tracking.
///
/// ### Query
///
/// Queries (both latest-at & range semantics) will defer to `RowId` order as a tie-breaker when
/// looking at several rows worth of data that rest at the exact same timestamp.
///
/// In pseudo-code:
/// ```text
/// rr.set_time_sequence("frame", 10)
///
/// rr.log("my_entity", point1, row_id=#1)
/// rr.log("my_entity", point2, row_id=#0)
///
/// rr.query("my_entity", at=("frame", 10))  # returns `point1`
/// ```
///
/// Think carefully about your `RowId`s when logging a lot of data at the same timestamp.
///
/// ### Garbage collection
///
/// Garbage collection is handled at the chunk level by first ordering the chunks based on the minimum
/// [`RowId`] present in each of them.
/// Garbage collection therefore happens (roughly) in the logger's wall-clock order.
