A runtime registry of known Rerun types (components, archetypes, â€¦).

This crate has minimal dependencies, and can be used to do runtime lookup about components and archetypes based only on their names.
The whole crate is generated by [`re_types_builder`](../re_types_builder).
It is basically a runtime reflection of the input `.fbs` files in [`re_types`](../re_types).
