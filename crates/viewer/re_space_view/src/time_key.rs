/// The `Ord` for this ignores `row_id`.
/// This is so that our zipping iterators will ignore the row id when comparing.
/// This is important for static data, especially when it comes to overrides.
/// If you override some static data (e.g. point cloud radius), the row id should be ignored,
/// otherwise the zipping iterators will say the override came _after_ the original data,
/// and so by latest-at semantics, the override will be ignored.
