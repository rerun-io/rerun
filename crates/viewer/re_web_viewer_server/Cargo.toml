[features]
## This crate embeds the web viewer `.wasm`, and so before building this crate you must build the `.wasm` using `pixi run rerun-build-web-release`.
##
## If for some reason you need to build this crate _without_ the `.wasm` being built, then you can do so in one of two ways:
## * Use `--features __disable_server` when building this crate (or `--all-features`).
## * Compile with the env-var `RERUN_DISABLE_WEB_VIEWER_SERVER=1`
##
## This will cause this crate to build despite the `.wasm` being missing, BUT it will panic at runtime!
## For instance: when rustdoc builds the docs for this crates, it uses `--all-features`, which means
## it can build the docs for this crate without having to build the web-viewer first.
## Similarly, our CI will enable `RERUN_DISABLE_WEB_VIEWER_SERVER=1` before building unit tests,
## because none of the unit tests actually rely on us serving the `.wasm` file.
__disable_server = []

## Build the binary to expect web viewer assets in trailing data.
## This can be enabled in two ways:
## * Compile with the env-var `RERUN_TRAILING_WEB_VIEWER=1`
## * Use `--features __trailing_web_viewer` when building this crate
##
## When enabled, the binary will NOT include the web viewer assets at compile time.
## Instead, it expects them to be appended as a zip archive via a post-processing step
## using `scripts/append_web_viewer.py`. This allows parallel building of CLI and web viewer
## in CI, which are then combined later.
##
## WARNING: Binaries built this way CANNOT serve the web viewer until the post-processing
## step is completed. Attempting to do so will result in a panic.

## Enable anonymized telemetry using our analytics SDK.
