## Learn how to use Rerun to build CV systems faster

Rerun is built to help developers debug and understand computer vision and robotics systems
by quickly visualizing internal state and data.

- Jump right in with the a quick start for [Python](getting-started/python.md) or [Rust](getting-started/rust.md).
- Follow it up with the [Viewer Walkthrough](getting-started/viewer-walkthrough.md) and a tutorial on logging data with [Python](getting-started/logging-python.md) or [Rust](getting-started/logging-rust.md).
- Dive deeper in the [Concepts](concepts) section.
- The [Reference](reference) covers specific primitives, configuration and API details.

## What is Rerun?

Rerun is a tool for logging and visually exploring computer vision and robotics data over time. It's used to debug and understand the internal state and data of your systems with minimal code.
Over time, Rerun will evolve from a tool to a fully customizable toolkit,
where you’ll have control over everything from layout to data transforms and shaders.
You’ll even be able to embed single views inside other applications.

It's made up of the Rerun SDK and the Rerun Viewer

- The Rerun SDK lets you log data from [Python](getting-started/python.md) or [Rust](getting-started/rust.md)
- The [Rerun Viewer](reference/viewer/overview.md) lets you view data live or from a recording.
