Rerun currently works with both [Python](getting-started/logging-python.md) and [Rust](getting-started/logging-rust.md).
If you are looking for other language support, search for an open issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun/issues) to find the status. If you can't find an issue for your language, [open one](https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun/issues/new/choose).

The fastest way to get started is with a quick start guide for [C++](getting-started/quick-start/cpp.md), [Python](getting-started/quick-start/python.md) or [Rust](getting-started/quick-start/rust.md).

Many of our [examples](/examples) currently utilize Python. Even for
Rust users, these examples are a good way to get a sense of how Rerun works and how you might use it in your own
project.
