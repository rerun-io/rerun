Rerun helps robotics and Physical AI teams iterate faster by providing unified infrastructure for working with multimodal data and time series data.

With Rerun, you can log data from any sensor, visualize it in our interactive viewer, and query it using dataframes. You can do this with a simple SDK that understands time and natively handles multi-rate data.
