Learn how visualizations are constructed in the Rerun Viewer.

The Viewer uses a blueprint-based system where:
- **Blueprints** define what data is shown and how views are arranged
- **Visualizers** determine how specific data types are rendered
- **Annotation contexts** provide semantic meaning for visualization

This section covers:
- [Blueprints](building-visualization/blueprints.md): Configuring views and layouts
- [Visualizers and Overrides](building-visualization/visualizers-and-overrides.md): How data is visualized and customized
- [Annotation Context](building-visualization/annotation-context.md): Semantic annotations for visualization
