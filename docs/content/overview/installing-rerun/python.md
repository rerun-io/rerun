Install the Rerun SDK for Python using one of the following methods:

-   `pip install rerun-sdk` via pip
-   `conda install -c conda-forge rerun-sdk` via Conda

Either way this includes both the SDK & the Viewer and you're ready to go!

## Next steps

To start getting your own data streamed to the viewer, check the [Python quick start guide](../../getting-started/data-in/quick-start/python.md).
