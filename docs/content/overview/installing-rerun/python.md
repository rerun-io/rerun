The Python SDK includes both the SDK and the Viewer, so you're ready to go with a single install:

-   `pip install rerun-sdk` via pip
-   `conda install -c conda-forge rerun-sdk` via Conda

## Next steps

To start getting your own data streamed to the viewer, check out the [Python quick start guide](../../getting-started/data-in/python.md).
