Rerun is a Data Platform for Physical Data.
The open source SDK connects to the cloud Data Platform, which allows you to store, retrieve, and query over large amounts of data, and integrates with the SDK so you can browse and inspect the data visually.

The open source Rerun SDK includes a simplified Data Platform server, which is API compatible with the cloud platform.
The open source server loads everything into memory, which makes it fast and simple to operate for very small datasets, which in turn makes it perfect for quick testing and local experimentation.

See the [how to guide for the open source server](howto/get-data-out.md) for more details on launching and connecting to the server.
