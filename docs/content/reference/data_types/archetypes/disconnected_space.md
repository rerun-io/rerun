title: "DisconnectedSpace"
---

Specifies that the entity path at which this is logged is disconnected from its parent.

This is useful for specifying that a subgraph is independent of the rest of the scene.

If a transform or pinhole is logged on the same path, this archetype's components
will be ignored.
