order: 100

How we interpret the coordinate system of an entity/space.

For instance: What is "up"? What does the Z axis mean? Is this right-handed or left-handed?

The three coordinates are always ordered as [x, y, z].

For example [Right, Down, Forward] means that the X axis points to the right, the Y axis points
down, and the Z axis points forward.
