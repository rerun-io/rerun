## rerun


The Rerun command-line interface:
* Spawn viewers to visualize Rerun recordings and other supported formats.
* Start TCP and WebSocket servers to share recordings over the network, on native or web.
* Inspect, edit and filter Rerun recordings.


**Usage**: ` rerun [OPTIONS] [URL_OR_PATHS]… [COMMAND]`

**Commands**

* `analytics`: Configure the behavior of our analytics.
* `rrd`: Manipulate the contents of .rrd and .rbl files.
* `reset`: Reset the memory of the Rerun Viewer.
* `man`: Generates the Rerun CLI manual (markdown).

**Arguments**

* `<URL_OR_PATHS>`
> Any combination of:
> - A WebSocket url to a Rerun server
> - A path to a Rerun .rrd recording
> - A path to a Rerun .rbl blueprint
> - An HTTP(S) URL to an .rrd or .rbl file to load
> - A path to an image or mesh, or any other file that Rerun can load (see https://www.rerun.io/docs/reference/data-loaders/overview)
>
> If no arguments are given, a server will be hosted which a Rerun SDK can connect to.

**Options**

* `--bind <BIND>`
> What bind address IP to use.
>
> [Default: `0.0.0.0`]

* `--drop-at-latency <DROP_AT_LATENCY>`
> Set a maximum input latency, e.g. "200ms" or "10s".
>
> If we go over this, we start dropping packets.
>
> The default is no limit, which means Rerun might eat more and more memory and have longer and longer latency, if you are logging data faster than Rerun can index it.

* `--memory-limit <MEMORY_LIMIT>`
> An upper limit on how much memory the Rerun Viewer should use.
> When this limit is reached, Rerun will drop the oldest data.
> Example: `16GB` or `50%` (of system total).
>
> [Default: `75%`]

* `--server-memory-limit <SERVER_MEMORY_LIMIT>`
> An upper limit on how much memory the WebSocket server should use.
> The server buffers log messages for the benefit of late-arriving viewers.
> When this limit is reached, Rerun will drop the oldest data.
> Example: `16GB` or `50%` (of system total).
>
> [Default: `25%`]

* `--persist-state <PERSIST_STATE>`
> Whether the Rerun Viewer should persist the state of the viewer to disk.
> When persisted, the state will be stored at the following locations:
> - Linux: `/home/UserName/.local/share/rerun`
> - macOS: `/Users/UserName/Library/Application Support/rerun`
> - Windows: `C:\Users\UserName\AppData\Roaming\rerun`
>
> [Default: `true`]

* `--port <PORT>`
> What TCP port do we listen to (for SDKs to connect to)?
>
> [Default: `9876`]

* `--profile <PROFILE>`
> Start with the puffin profiler running.
>
> [Default: `false`]

* `--save <SAVE>`
> Stream incoming log events to an .rrd file at the given path.

* `--screenshot-to <SCREENSHOT_TO>`
> Take a screenshot of the app and quit. We use this to generate screenshots of our examples. Useful together with `--window-size`.

* `--serve <SERVE>`
> Serve the recordings over WebSocket to one or more Rerun Viewers.
>
> This will also host a web-viewer over HTTP that can connect to the WebSocket address, but you can also connect with the native binary.
>
> `rerun --serve` will act like a proxy, listening for incoming TCP connection from logging SDKs, and forwarding it to Rerun viewers.
>
> [Default: `false`]

* `--expect-data-soon <EXPECT_DATA_SOON>`
> This is a hint that we expect a recording to stream in very soon.
>
> This is set by the `spawn()` method in our logging SDK.
>
> The viewer will respond by fading in the welcome screen, instead of showing it directly. This ensures that it won't blink for a few frames before switching to the recording.
>
> [Default: `false`]

* `-j, --threads <THREADS>`
> The number of compute threads to use.
>
> If zero, the same number of threads as the number of cores will be used. If negative, will use that much fewer threads than cores.
>
> Rerun will still use some additional threads for I/O.
>
> [Default: `-2`]

* `--version <VERSION>`
> Print version and quit.
>
> [Default: `false`]

* `--web-viewer <WEB_VIEWER>`
> Start the viewer in the browser (instead of locally).
>
> Requires Rerun to have been compiled with the 'web_viewer' feature.
>
> This implies `--serve`.
>
> [Default: `false`]

* `--web-viewer-port <WEB_VIEWER_PORT>`
> What port do we listen to for hosting the web viewer over HTTP. A port of 0 will pick a random port.
>
> [Default: `9090`]

* `--hide-welcome-screen <HIDE_WELCOME_SCREEN>`
> Hide the normal Rerun welcome screen.
>
> [Default: `false`]

* `--window-size <WINDOW_SIZE>`
> Set the screen resolution (in logical points), e.g. "1920x1080". Useful together with `--screenshot-to`.

* `--ws-server-port <WS_SERVER_PORT>`
> What port do we listen to for incoming websocket connections from the viewer A port of 0 will pick a random port.
>
> [Default: `9877`]

* `--renderer <RENDERER>`
> Override the default graphics backend and for a specific one instead.
>
> When using `--web-viewer` this should be one of: `webgpu`, `webgl`.
>
> When starting a native viewer instead this should be one of:
>
> * `vulkan` (Linux & Windows only)
>
> * `gl` (Linux & Windows only)
>
> * `metal` (macOS only)

* `--test-receive <TEST_RECEIVE>`
> Ingest data and then quit once the goodbye message has been received.
>
> Used for testing together with `RERUN_PANIC_ON_WARN=1`.
>
> Fails if no messages are received, or if no messages are received within a dozen or so seconds.
>
> [Default: `false`]

Uses the usual environment variables to control the compaction thresholds: `RERUN_CHUNK_MAX_ROWS`, `RERUN_CHUNK_MAX_ROWS_IF_UNSORTED`, `RERUN_CHUNK_MAX_BYTES`.

Unless explicit flags are passed, in which case they will override environment values.

Examples:
