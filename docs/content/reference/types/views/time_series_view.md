A time series view.

## Properties

### `ScalarAxis`
Configuration for the scalar axis of a plot.

* range: The range of the axis.
* lock_range_during_zoom: Whether to lock the range of the axis during zoom.
### `PlotLegend`
Configuration for the legend of a plot.

* corner: To what corner the legend is aligned.
* visible: Whether the legend is shown at all.
### `VisibleTimeRange`
Configures what range of the timeline is shown on a view.

Whenever no visual time range applies, queries are done with "latest at" semantics.
This means that the view will, starting from the time cursor position,
query the latest data available for each component type.

The default visual time range depends on the type of view this property applies to:
- For time series views, the default is to show the entire timeline.
- For any other view, the default is to apply latest-at semantics.

The visual time range can be overridden also individually per entity.

* sequence: The range of time to show for timelines based on sequence numbers.
* time: The range of time to show for timelines based on time.
