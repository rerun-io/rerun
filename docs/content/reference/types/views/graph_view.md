A graph view to display time-variying, directed or undirected graph visualization.

## Properties

### `visual_bounds`
Everything within these bounds is guaranteed to be visible.

Somethings outside of these bounds may also be visible due to letterboxing.
### `force_link`
Allows to control the interaction between two nodes connected by an edge.

* `enabled`: Whether the link force is enabled.
* `distance`: The target distance between two nodes.
* `iterations`: Specifies how often this force should be applied per iteration.
### `force_many_body`
A force between each pair of nodes that ressembles an electrical charge.

* `enabled`: Whether the many body force is enabled.
* `strength`: The strength of the force.
### `force_position`
Similar to gravity, this force pulls nodes towards a specific position.

* `enabled`: Whether the position force is enabled.
* `strength`: The strength of the force.
* `position`: The position where the nodes should be pulled towards.
### `force_collision_radius`
Resolves collisions between the bounding spheres, according to the radius of the nodes.

* `enabled`: Whether the collision force is enabled.
* `strength`: The strength of the force.
* `iterations`: Specifies how often this force should be applied per iteration.
### `force_center`
Tries to move the center of mass of the graph to the origin.

* `enabled`: Whether the center force is enabled.
* `strength`: The strength of the force.
