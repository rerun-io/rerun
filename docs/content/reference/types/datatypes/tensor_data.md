An N-dimensional array of numbers.

The number of dimensions and their respective lengths is specified by the `shape` field.
The dimensions are ordered from outermost to innermost. For example, in the common case of
a 2D RGB Image, the shape would be `[height, width, channel]`.

These dimensions are combined with an index to look up values from the `buffer` field,
which stores a contiguous array of typed values.

Note that the buffer may be encoded in a compressed format such as `jpeg` or
in a format with downsampled chroma, such as NV12 or YUY2.
For file formats, the shape is used as a hint, for chroma downsampled format
the shape has to be the shape of the decoded image.
