<!-- DO NOT EDIT! This file was auto-generated by crates/build/re_types_builder/src/codegen/docs/mod.rs -->

Specifieds a particular format of an [`archetypes.Image`](https://rerun.io/docs/reference/types/archetypes/image).

Most images can be described by a [`datatypes.ColorModel`](https://rerun.io/docs/reference/types/datatypes/color_model) and a [`datatypes.ChannelDatatype`](https://rerun.io/docs/reference/types/datatypes/channel_datatype),
e.g. `RGB` and `U8` respectively.

However, some image formats has chroma downsampling and/or
use differing number of bits per channel, and that is what this [`datatypes.PixelFormat`](https://rerun.io/docs/reference/types/datatypes/pixel_format) is for.

All these formats support random access.

For more compressed image formats, see [`archetypes.EncodedImage`](https://rerun.io/docs/reference/types/archetypes/encoded_image).

## Variants
#### `Y_U_V12_LimitedRange` = 20
`Y_U_V12` is a YUV 4:2:0 fully planar YUV format without chroma downsampling, also known as `I420`.

This uses limited range YUV, i.e. Y is expected to be within [16, 235] and U/V within [16, 240].

First comes entire image in Y in one plane, followed by the U and V planes, which each only have half
the resolution of the Y plane.

#### `NV12` = 26
`NV12` (aka `Y_UV12`) is a YUV 4:2:0 chroma downsampled form at with 12 bits per pixel and 8 bits per channel.

This uses limited range YUV, i.e. Y is expected to be within [16, 235] and U/V within [16, 240].

First comes entire image in Y in one plane,
followed by a plane with interleaved lines ordered as U0, V0, U1, V1, etc.

#### `YUY2` = 27
`YUY2` (aka `YUYV`, `YUYV16` or `NV21`), is a YUV 4:2:2 chroma downsampled format with 16 bits per pixel and 8 bits per channel.

This uses limited range YUV, i.e. Y is expected to be within [16, 235] and U/V within [16, 240].

The order of the channels is Y0, U0, Y1, V0, all in the same plane.

#### `Y8_FullRange` = 30
Monochrome Y plane only, essentially a YUV 4:0:0 planar format.

Also known as just "gray". This is virtually identical to a 8bit luminance/grayscale (see [`datatypes.ColorModel`](https://rerun.io/docs/reference/types/datatypes/color_model)).

This uses entire range YUV, i.e. Y is expected to be within [0, 255].
(as opposed to "limited range" YUV as used e.g. in NV12).

#### `Y_U_V24_LimitedRange` = 39
`Y_U_V24` is a YUV 4:4:4 fully planar YUV format without chroma downsampling, also known as `I444`.

This uses limited range YUV, i.e. Y is expected to be within [16, 235] and U/V within [16, 240].

First comes entire image in Y in one plane, followed by the U and V planes.

#### `Y_U_V24_FullRange` = 40
`Y_U_V24` is a YUV 4:4:4 fully planar YUV format without chroma downsampling, also known as `I444`.

This uses full range YUV with all components ranging from 0 to 255
(as opposed to "limited range" YUV as used e.g. in NV12).

First comes entire image in Y in one plane, followed by the U and V planes.

#### `Y8_LimitedRange` = 41
Monochrome Y plane only, essentially a YUV 4:0:0 planar format.

Also known as just "gray".

This uses limited range YUV, i.e. Y is expected to be within [16, 235].
If not for this range limitation/remapping, this is almost identical to 8bit luminace/grayscale (see [`datatypes.ColorModel`](https://rerun.io/docs/reference/types/datatypes/color_model)).

#### `Y_U_V12_FullRange` = 44
`Y_U_V12` is a YUV 4:2:0 fully planar YUV format without chroma downsampling, also known as `I420`.

This uses full range YUV with all components ranging from 0 to 255
(as opposed to "limited range" YUV as used e.g. in NV12).

First comes entire image in Y in one plane, followed by the U and V planes, which each only have half
the resolution of the Y plane.

#### `Y_U_V16_LimitedRange` = 49
`Y_U_V16` is a YUV 4:2:2 fully planar YUV format without chroma downsampling, also known as `I422`.

This uses limited range YUV, i.e. Y is expected to be within [16, 235] and U/V within [16, 240].

First comes entire image in Y in one plane, followed by the U and V planes, which each only have half
the horizontal resolution of the Y plane.

#### `Y_U_V16_FullRange` = 50
`Y_U_V16` is a YUV 4:2:2 fully planar YUV format without chroma downsampling, also known as `I422`.

This uses full range YUV with all components ranging from 0 to 255
(as opposed to "limited range" YUV as used e.g. in NV12).

First comes entire image in Y in one plane, followed by the U and V planes, which each only have half
the horizontal resolution of the Y plane.
