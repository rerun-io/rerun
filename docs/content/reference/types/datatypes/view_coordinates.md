How we interpret the coordinate system of an entity/space.

For instance: What is "up"? What does the Z axis mean?

The three coordinates are always ordered as [x, y, z].

For example [Right, Down, Forward] means that the X axis points to the right, the Y axis points
down, and the Z axis points forward.

‚ö† [Rerun does not yet support left-handed coordinate systems](https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun/issues/5032).

The following constants are used to represent the different directions:
 * Up = 1
 * Down = 2
 * Right = 3
 * Left = 4
 * Forward = 5
 * Back = 6

## Fields

* coordinates: 3x `u8`
