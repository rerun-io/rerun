Archetypes are bundles of components for which the Rerun viewer has first-class
built-in support. When logged, each archetype also includes an _indicator component_ which captures
the intent of the logging code and triggers the activation of the corresponding visualizers. See
[Entities and Compponents](../../concepts/entity-component.md) and
[Visualizers and Overrides](../../concepts/visualizers-and-overrides.md) for more information.

This page lists all built-in archetypes.

## Geospatial

* [`GeoLineStrings`](archetypes/geo_line_strings.md): Geospatial line strings with positions expressed in [EPSG:4326](https://epsg.io/4326) altitude and longitude (North/East-positive degrees), and optional colors and radii.
* [`GeoPoints`](archetypes/geo_points.md): Geospatial points with positions expressed in [EPSG:4326](https://epsg.io/4326) latitude and longitude (North/East-positive degrees), and optional colors and radii.

## Graph

* [`GraphEdges`](archetypes/graph_edges.md): A list of edges in a graph.
* [`GraphNodes`](archetypes/graph_nodes.md): A list of nodes in a graph with optional labels, colors, etc.

## Image & tensor

* [`DepthImage`](archetypes/depth_image.md): A depth image, i.e. as captured by a depth camera.
* [`EncodedImage`](archetypes/encoded_image.md): An image encoded as e.g. a JPEG or PNG.
* [`Image`](archetypes/image.md): A monochrome or color image.
* [`SegmentationImage`](archetypes/segmentation_image.md): An image made up of integer [`components.ClassId`](https://rerun.io/docs/reference/types/components/class_id)s.
* [`Tensor`](archetypes/tensor.md): An N-dimensional array of numbers.

## Plotting

* [`BarChart`](archetypes/bar_chart.md): A bar chart.
* [`Scalar`](archetypes/scalar.md): A double-precision scalar, e.g. for use for time-series plots.
* [`SeriesLine`](archetypes/series_line.md): Define the style properties for a line series in a chart.
* [`SeriesPoint`](archetypes/series_point.md): Define the style properties for a point series in a chart.

## Spatial 2D

* [`Arrows2D`](archetypes/arrows2d.md): 2D arrows with optional colors, radii, labels, etc.
* [`Boxes2D`](archetypes/boxes2d.md): 2D boxes with half-extents and optional center, colors etc.
* [`LineStrips2D`](archetypes/line_strips2d.md): 2D line strips with positions and optional colors, radii, labels, etc.
* [`Points2D`](archetypes/points2d.md): A 2D point cloud with positions and optional colors, radii, labels, etc.

## Spatial 3D

* [`Arrows3D`](archetypes/arrows3d.md): 3D arrows with optional colors, radii, labels, etc.
* [`Asset3D`](archetypes/asset3d.md): A prepacked 3D asset (`.gltf`, `.glb`, `.obj`, `.stl`, etc.).
* [`Boxes3D`](archetypes/boxes3d.md): 3D boxes with half-extents and optional center, rotations, colors etc.
* [`Capsules3D`](archetypes/capsules3d.md): 3D capsules; cylinders with hemispherical caps.
* [`Ellipsoids3D`](archetypes/ellipsoids3d.md): 3D ellipsoids or spheres.
* [`InstancePoses3D`](archetypes/instance_poses3d.md): One or more transforms between the current entity and its parent. Unlike [`archetypes.Transform3D`](https://rerun.io/docs/reference/types/archetypes/transform3d), it is *not* propagated in the transform hierarchy.
* [`LineStrips3D`](archetypes/line_strips3d.md): 3D line strips with positions and optional colors, radii, labels, etc.
* [`Mesh3D`](archetypes/mesh3d.md): A 3D triangle mesh as specified by its per-mesh and per-vertex properties.
* [`Pinhole`](archetypes/pinhole.md): Camera perspective projection (a.k.a. intrinsics).
* [`Points3D`](archetypes/points3d.md): A 3D point cloud with positions and optional colors, radii, labels, etc.
* [`Transform3D`](archetypes/transform3d.md): A transform between two 3D spaces, i.e. a pose.
* [`ViewCoordinates`](archetypes/view_coordinates.md): How we interpret the coordinate system of an entity/space.

## Text

* [`TextDocument`](archetypes/text_document.md): A text element intended to be displayed in its own text box.
* [`TextLog`](archetypes/text_log.md): A log entry in a text log, comprised of a text body and its log level.

## Video

* [`AssetVideo`](archetypes/asset_video.md): A video binary.
* [`VideoFrameReference`](archetypes/video_frame_reference.md): References a single video frame.

## Other

* [`AnnotationContext`](archetypes/annotation_context.md): The annotation context provides additional information on how to display entities.
* [`Clear`](archetypes/clear.md): Empties all the components of an entity.
* [`DisconnectedSpace`](archetypes/disconnected_space.md): Spatially disconnect this entity from its parent.
