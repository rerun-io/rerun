‚ö†Ô∏è **This type is _unstable_ and may change significantly in a way that the data won't be backwards compatible.**
A string identifier for a transform frame.

**Experimental:** Transform frames are still in early development!

Transform frames may be derived from entity paths to refer to Rerun's implicit
entity path driven hierarchy which is defined via [`archetypes.Transform3D`](https://rerun.io/docs/reference/types/archetypes/transform3d), [`archetypes.Pinhole`](https://rerun.io/docs/reference/types/archetypes/pinhole) etc..
Note that any transform logged at an entity path describes a relationship between the two transform
frames represented by that entity path and its parent path,
**not** the transform frame that the entity path may be using.
