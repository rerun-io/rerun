<!-- DO NOT EDIT! This file was auto-generated by crates/build/re_types_builder/src/codegen/docs/website.rs -->

⚠️ **This type is _unstable_ and may change significantly in a way that the data won't be backwards compatible.**
The codec used to encode video stored in [`components.VideoSample`](https://rerun.io/docs/reference/types/components/video_sample).

Support of these codecs by the Rerun Viewer is platform dependent.
For more details see check the [video reference](https://rerun.io/docs/reference/video).

## Variants
#### `H264` = 0x61766331
Advanced Video Coding (AVC/H.264)

See <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Video_Coding>

[`components.VideoSample`](https://rerun.io/docs/reference/types/components/video_sample)s using this codec should be formatted according to Annex B specification.
(Note that this is different from AVCC format found in MP4 files.
To learn more about Annex B, check for instance <https://membrane.stream/learn/h264/3>)
Key frames (IDR) require inclusion of a SPS (Sequence Parameter Set)

Enum value is the fourcc for 'avc1' (the WebCodec string assigned to this codec) in big endian.

#### `H265` = 0x68657631
High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC/H.265)

See <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Efficiency_Video_Coding>

[`components.VideoSample`](https://rerun.io/docs/reference/types/components/video_sample)s using this codec should be formatted according to Annex B specification.
(Note that this is different from AVCC format found in MP4 files.
To learn more about Annex B, check for instance <https://membrane.stream/learn/h264/3>)
Key frames (IRAP) require inclusion of a SPS (Sequence Parameter Set)

Enum value is the fourcc for 'hev1' (the WebCodec string assigned to this codec) in big endian.
