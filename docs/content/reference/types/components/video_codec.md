⚠️ **This type is _unstable_ and may change significantly in a way that the data won't be backwards compatible.**
The codec used to encode video stored in [`components.VideoSample`](https://rerun.io/docs/reference/types/components/video_sample).

Support of these codecs by the Rerun Viewer is platform dependent.
For more details see check the [video reference](https://rerun.io/docs/reference/video).

## Variants
#### `AV1` = 0x61763031
AOMedia Video 1 (AV1)

See <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AV1>

[`components.VideoSample`](https://rerun.io/docs/reference/types/components/video_sample)s using this codec should be formatted according the "Low overhead bitstream format",
as specified in Section 5.2 of the [AV1 specification](https://aomediacodec.github.io/av1-spec/#low-overhead-bitstream-format).
Each sample should be formatted as a sequence of OBUs (Open Bitstream Units) long enough to decode at least one video frame.
Samples containing keyframes must include a sequence header OBU before the `KEY_FRAME` OBU to enable
extraction of frame dimensions, bit depth, and color information. `INTRA_ONLY` frames are not treated
as keyframes since they may reference existing decoder state.

Enum value is the fourcc for 'av01' (the WebCodec string assigned to this codec) in big endian.

#### `H264` = 0x61766331
Advanced Video Coding (AVC/H.264)

See <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Video_Coding>

[`components.VideoSample`](https://rerun.io/docs/reference/types/components/video_sample)s using this codec should be formatted according to Annex B specification.
(Note that this is different from AVCC format found in MP4 files.
To learn more about Annex B, check for instance <https://membrane.stream/learn/h264/3>)
Key frames (IDR) require inclusion of a SPS (Sequence Parameter Set)

Enum value is the fourcc for 'avc1' (the WebCodec string assigned to this codec) in big endian.

#### `H265` = 0x68657631
High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC/H.265)

See <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Efficiency_Video_Coding>

[`components.VideoSample`](https://rerun.io/docs/reference/types/components/video_sample)s using this codec should be formatted according to Annex B specification.
(Note that this is different from AVCC format found in MP4 files.
To learn more about Annex B, check for instance <https://membrane.stream/learn/h264/3>)
Key frames (IRAP) require inclusion of a SPS (Sequence Parameter Set)

Enum value is the fourcc for 'hev1' (the WebCodec string assigned to this codec) in big endian.
