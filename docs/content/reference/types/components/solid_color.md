An RGBA color for the surface of an object.

In representation and color space, this is identical to [`components.Color`](https://rerun.io/docs/reference/types/components/color).
Unlike that component, it is used specifically to request that this color should be
applied to the entire surface of the object (as opposed to the lines of a wireframe).
