Filter used when a single texel/pixel of an image is displayed larger than a single screen pixel.

This happens when zooming into an image, when displaying a low-resolution image in a large area,
or when viewing an image up close in 3D space.

## Variants
#### `Nearest` = 1
Show the nearest pixel value.

This will give a blocky appearance when the image is scaled up.
Used as default when rendering 2D images.

#### `Linear` = 2
Linearly interpolate the nearest neighbors, creating a smoother look when the image is scaled up.

Used as default for mesh rendering.

#### `Bicubic` = 3
Bicubic interpolation using a Catmull-Rom spline, creating the smoothest look when the image is scaled up.

This is computationally more expensive than linear filtering but produces sharper results with less blurring.
Unlike bilinear filtering, this avoids cross-shaped artifacts at texel boundaries.
