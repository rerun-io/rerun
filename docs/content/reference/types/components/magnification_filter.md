Filter used when magnifying an image/texture such that a single pixel/texel is displayed as multiple pixels on screen.

## Variants
#### `Nearest` = 1
Show the nearest pixel value.

This will give a blocky appearance when zooming in.
Used as default when rendering 2D images.

#### `Linear` = 2
Linearly interpolate the nearest neighbors, creating a smoother look when zooming in.

Used as default for mesh rendering.
