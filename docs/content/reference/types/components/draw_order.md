title: "DrawOrder"
---

Draw order used for the display order of 2D elements.

Higher values are drawn on top of lower values.
An entity can have only a single draw order component.
Within an entity draw order is governed by the order of the components.

Draw order for entities with the same draw order is generally undefined.
