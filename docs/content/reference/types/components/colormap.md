Colormap for mapping scalar values within a given range to a color.

This provides a number of popular pre-defined colormaps.
In the future, the Rerun Viewer will allow users to define their own colormaps,
but currently the Viewer is limited to the types defined here.

## Variants
#### `Grayscale` = 1
A simple black to white gradient.

This is a sRGB gray gradient which is perceptually uniform.

#### `Inferno` = 2
The Inferno colormap from Matplotlib.

This is a perceptually uniform colormap.
It interpolates from black to red to bright yellow.

#### `Magma` = 3
The Magma colormap from Matplotlib.

This is a perceptually uniform colormap.
It interpolates from black to purple to white.

#### `Plasma` = 4
The Plasma colormap from Matplotlib.

This is a perceptually uniform colormap.
It interpolates from dark blue to purple to yellow.

#### `Turbo` = 5
Google's Turbo colormap map.

This is a perceptually non-uniform rainbow colormap addressing many issues of
more traditional rainbow colormaps like Jet.
It is more perceptually uniform without sharp transitions and is more colorblind-friendly.

#### `Viridis` = 6
The Viridis colormap from Matplotlib

This is a perceptually uniform colormap which is robust to color blindness.
It interpolates from dark purple to green to yellow.

#### `CyanToYellow` = 7
Rasmusgo's Cyan to Yellow colormap

This is a perceptually uniform colormap which is robust to color blindness.
It is especially suited for visualizing signed values.
It interpolates from cyan to blue to dark gray to brass to yellow.
