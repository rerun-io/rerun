Colormap for mapping scalar values within a given range to a color.

This provides a number of popular pre-defined colormaps.
In the future, the Rerun Viewer will allow users to define their own colormaps,
but currently the Viewer is limited to the types defined here.

## Variants
* `Grayscale` = 1
* `Inferno` = 2
* `Magma` = 3
* `Plasma` = 4
* `Turbo` = 5
* `Viridis` = 6
* `CyanToYellow` = 7
