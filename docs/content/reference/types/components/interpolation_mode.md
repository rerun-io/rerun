Specifies how values between data points are interpolated in a time series line chart.

## Variants
#### `Linear` = 1
Connect data points with straight line segments.

#### `StepAfter` = 2
Hold the previous value until the next data point, then jump.

The step occurs at the end of the interval.

#### `StepBefore` = 3
Jump to the new value immediately, then hold until the next data point.

The step occurs at the beginning of the interval.

#### `StepMid` = 4
Hold the previous value until the midpoint between data points, then jump to the new value.

The step occurs at the midpoint of the interval.


## Arrow datatype
