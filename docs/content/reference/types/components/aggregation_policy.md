Policy for aggregation of multiple scalar plot values.

This is used for lines in plots when the X axis distance of individual points goes below a single pixel,
i.e. a single pixel covers more than one tick worth of data. It can greatly improve performance
(and readability) in such situations as it prevents overdraw.
