Policy for aggregation of multiple scalar plot values.

This is used for lines in plots when the X axis distance of individual points goes below a single pixel,
i.e. a single pixel covers more than one tick worth of data. It can greatly improve performance
(and readability) in such situations as it prevents overdraw.

## Variants
#### `Off` = 1
No aggregation.

#### `Average` = 2
Average all points in the range together.

#### `Max` = 3
Keep only the maximum values in the range.

#### `Min` = 4
Keep only the minimum values in the range.

#### `MinMax` = 5
Keep both the minimum and maximum values in the range.

This will yield two aggregated points instead of one, effectively creating a vertical line.

#### `MinMaxAverage` = 6
Find both the minimum and maximum values in the range, then use the average of those.
