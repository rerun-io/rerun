The radius of something, e.g. a point.

Internally, positive values indicate scene units, whereas negative values
are interpreted as UI points.

UI points are independent of zooming in Views, but are sensitive to the application UI scaling.
at 100% UI scaling, UI points are equal to pixels
The Viewer's UI scaling defaults to the OS scaling which typically is 100% for full HD screens and 200% for 4k screens.
