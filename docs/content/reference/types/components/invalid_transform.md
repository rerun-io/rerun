Flags the transform at its entity path as invalid.

Specifies that the entity path at which this is logged is spatially disconnected from its parent,
making it impossible to transform the entity path into its parent's space and vice versa.
This can be useful for instance to express temporily unknown transforms.

Note that by default all transforms are considered valid.
