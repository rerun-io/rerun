Components are the fundamental unit of logging in Rerun. This page lists all built-in components.

An entity can only ever contain a single array of any given component type.
If you log the same component several times on an entity, the last value (or array of values) will overwrite the previous.

For more information on the relationship between **archetypes** and **components**, check out the concept page
on [Entities and Components](../../concepts/entity-component.md).
