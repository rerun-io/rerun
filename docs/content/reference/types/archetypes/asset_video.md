‚ö†Ô∏è **This is an experimental API! It is not fully supported, and is likely to change significantly in future versions.**

A video binary.

NOTE: Videos can only be viewed in the Rerun web viewer.
Only MP4 containers with a limited number of codecs are currently supported, and not in all browsers.
Follow <https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun/issues/7298> for updates on the native support.

In order to display a video, you need to log a [`archetypes.VideoFrameReference`](https://rerun.io/docs/reference/types/archetypes/video_frame_reference) for each frame.

## Components

**Required**: [`Blob`](../components/blob.md)

**Recommended**: [`MediaType`](../components/media_type.md)
