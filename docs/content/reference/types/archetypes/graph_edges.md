⚠️ **This is an experimental API! It is not fully supported, and is likely to change significantly in future versions.**

A list of edges in a graph.

By default, edges are undirected.

## Components

**Required**: [`GraphEdge`](../components/graph_edge.md)

**Recommended**: [`GraphType`](../components/graph_type.md)
