‚ö†Ô∏è **This type is _unstable_ and may change significantly in a way that the data won't be backwards compatible.**
Video stream consisting of raw video chunks.

For logging video containers like mp4, refer to [`archetypes.AssetVideo`](https://rerun.io/docs/reference/types/archetypes/asset_video) and [`archetypes.VideoFrameReference`](https://rerun.io/docs/reference/types/archetypes/video_frame_reference).
To learn more about video support in Rerun, check the [video reference](https://rerun.io/docs/reference/video).

All components except `sample` are typically logged statically once per entity.
`sample` is then logged repeatedly for each frame on the timeline.

TODO(#7484): Add snippet.
