‚ö†Ô∏è **This type is _unstable_ and may change significantly in a way that the data won't be backwards compatible.**
A channel within an MCAP file that defines how messages are structured and encoded.

Channels in MCAP files group messages by topic and define their encoding format.
Each channel has a unique identifier and specifies the message schema and encoding used
for all messages published to that topic.

See also [`archetypes.McapMessage`](https://rerun.io/docs/reference/types/archetypes/mcap_message?speculative-link) for individual messages within a channel,
[`archetypes.McapSchema`](https://rerun.io/docs/reference/types/archetypes/mcap_schema?speculative-link) for the data structure definitions, and the
[MCAP specification](https://mcap.dev/) for complete format details.
