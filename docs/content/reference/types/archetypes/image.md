A monochrome or color image.

The order of dimensions in the underlying [`components.TensorData`](https://rerun.io/docs/reference/types/components/tensor_data) follows the typical
row-major, interleaved-pixel image format. Additionally, Rerun orders the
[`datatypes.TensorDimension`](https://rerun.io/docs/reference/types/datatypes/tensor_dimension)s within the shape description from outer-most to inner-most.

As such, the shape of the [`components.TensorData`](https://rerun.io/docs/reference/types/components/tensor_data) must be mappable to:
- A `HxW` tensor, treated as a grayscale image.
- A `HxWx3` tensor, treated as an RGB image.
- A `HxWx4` tensor, treated as an RGBA image.

Leading and trailing unit-dimensions are ignored, so that
`1x480x640x3x1` is treated as a `480x640x3` RGB image.

Rerun also supports compressed image encoded as JPEG, N12, and YUY2.
Using these formats can save a lot of bandwidth and memory.

## Components
