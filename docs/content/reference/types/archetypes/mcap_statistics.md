⚠️ **This type is _unstable_ and may change significantly in a way that the data won't be backwards compatible.**
Recording-level statistics about an MCAP file, logged as a part of [`archetypes.RecordingInfo`](https://rerun.io/docs/reference/types/archetypes/recording_info).

This archetype contains summary information about an entire MCAP recording, including
counts of messages, schemas, channels, and other records, as well as timing information
spanning the full recording duration. It is typically logged once per recording to provide
an overview of the dataset's structure and content.

See also [`archetypes.McapChannel`](https://rerun.io/docs/reference/types/archetypes/mcap_channel) for individual channel definitions,
[`archetypes.McapMessage`](https://rerun.io/docs/reference/types/archetypes/mcap_message) for message content, [`archetypes.McapSchema`](https://rerun.io/docs/reference/types/archetypes/mcap_schema) for schema definitions,
and the [MCAP specification](https://mcap.dev/) for complete format details.
