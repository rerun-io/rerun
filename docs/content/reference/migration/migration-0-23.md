## Timelines are uniquely identified by name
Previously, you could (confusingly) have two timelines with the same name, as long as they had different types (sequence vs temporal).
This is no longer possible.
Timelines are now uniquely identified by name, and if you use different types on the same timeline, you will get a logged warning, and the _latest_ type will be used to interpret the full set of time data.
