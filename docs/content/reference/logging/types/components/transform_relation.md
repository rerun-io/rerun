Specifies relation a spatial transform describes.

## Variants
#### `ParentFromChild` = 1
The transform describes how to transform into the parent entity's space.

E.g. a translation of (0, 1, 0) with this [`components.TransformRelation`](https://rerun.io/docs/reference/types/components/transform_relation) logged at `parent/child` means
that from the point of view of `parent`, `parent/child` is translated 1 unit along `parent`'s Y axis.
From perspective of `parent/child`, the `parent` entity is translated -1 unit along `parent/child`'s Y axis.

#### `ChildFromParent` = 2
The transform describes how to transform into the child entity's space.

E.g. a translation of (0, 1, 0) with this [`components.TransformRelation`](https://rerun.io/docs/reference/types/components/transform_relation) logged at `parent/child` means
that from the point of view of `parent`, `parent/child` is translated -1 unit along `parent`'s Y axis.
From perspective of `parent/child`, the `parent` entity is translated 1 unit along `parent/child`'s Y axis.
