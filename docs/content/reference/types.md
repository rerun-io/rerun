Rerun has 3 levels of types that can be used in all SDK languages:

* [**Archetypes**](types/archetypes.md) - high level bundles of components.
* [**Components**](types/components.md) - the base unit of logging data.
* [**Data types**](types/datatypes.md) - that make up the individual components.

To get an overview of what the Rerun [Viewer](./viewer/overview.md) can show, start at [**Archetypes**](types/archetypes.md).

For more information on the relationship between **archetypes** and **components**, check out the concept page
on [Entities and Components](../concepts/logging-and-ingestion/entity-component.md).
