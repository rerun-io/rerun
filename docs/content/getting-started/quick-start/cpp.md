## Setup
Before adding Rerun to your application, start by [installing the viewer](installing-viewer.md).

## Learning by example
If you prefer to learn by example, check out our example repository which uses the Rerun C++ SDK to log some data from Eigen and OpenCV: <https://github.com/rerun-io/cpp-example-opencv-eigen>.

## Using Rerun with CMake

Assuming you are starting with a bare-bones `CMakeLists.txt` such as:

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.16...3.27)
project(example_minimal LANGUAGES CXX)

add_executable(example_minimal main.cpp)
```

You can add Rerun to your project using `FetchContent`

```cmake
include(FetchContent)
FetchContent_Declare(rerun_sdk URL
    https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun/releases/latest/download/rerun_cpp_sdk.zip)
FetchContent_MakeAvailable(rerun_sdk)
```
This will download a bundle with pre-built Rerun C static libraries for most desktop platforms,
all Rerun C++ sources and headers, as well as CMake build instructions for them.
By default this will in turn download & build [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/)'s C++ library which is required to build the Rerun C++.
See [Install arrow-cpp](https://ref.rerun.io/docs/cpp/stable/md__2home_2runner_2work_2rerun_2rerun_2rerun__cpp_2arrow__cpp__install.html) to learn more about this step and how to use an existing install.

Currently, Rerun SDK works with C++17 or newer, so you need to add this property to your target:

```cmake
set_property(TARGET example_minimal PROPERTY CXX_STANDARD 17)
```

And finally, make sure you link with `rerun_sdk`:

```cmake
target_link_libraries(example_minimal PRIVATE rerun_sdk)
```

Combining the above, a minimal self-contained `CMakeLists.txt` looks like:

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.16...3.27)
project(example_minimal LANGUAGES CXX)

add_executable(example_minimal main.cpp)

# Download the rerun_sdk
include(FetchContent)
FetchContent_Declare(rerun_sdk URL
    https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun/releases/latest/download/rerun_cpp_sdk.zip)
FetchContent_MakeAvailable(rerun_sdk)

# Rerun requires at least C++17, but it should be compatible with newer versions.
set_property(TARGET example_minimal PROPERTY CXX_STANDARD 17)

# Link against rerun_sdk.
target_link_libraries(example_minimal PRIVATE rerun_sdk)
```

## Logging some data
Add the following code to your `main.cpp`
(this example also lives in the `rerun` source tree [example](https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun/blob/latest/examples/cpp/minimal/main.cpp)):

```cpp
#include <rerun.hpp>
#include <rerun/demo_utils.hpp>

using namespace rerun::demo;

int main() {
    // Create a new `RecordingStream` which sends data over TCP to the viewer process.
    const auto rec = rerun::RecordingStream("rerun_example_cpp");
    // Try to spawn a new viewer instance.
    rec.spawn().exit_on_failure();

    // Create some data using the `grid` utility function.
    std::vector<rerun::Position3D> points = grid3d<rerun::Position3D, float>(-10.f, 10.f, 10);
    std::vector<rerun::Color> colors = grid3d<rerun::Color, uint8_t>(0, 255, 10);

    // Log the "my_points" entity with our data, using the `Points3D` archetype.
    rec.log("my_points", rerun::Points3D(points).with_colors(colors).with_radii({0.5f}));
}
```

## Building and running

You can configure cmake, build, and run your application like so:
```bash
cmake -B build
cmake --build build -j
./build/example_minimal
```

Once everything finishes compiling, the application will spawn the rerun viewer and send the data to it:

## Using the viewer
Try out the following to interact with the viewer:
 * Click and drag in the main view to rotate the cube.
 * Zoom in and out with the scroll wheel.
 * Mouse over the "?" icons to find out about more controls.
 * Click on the cube to select all of the points.
 * Hover and select individual points to see more information.

If you're facing any difficulties, don't hesitate to [open an issue](https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun/issues/new/choose) or [join the Discord server](https://discord.gg/PXtCgFBSmH).

## What's next

If you're ready to move on to more advanced topics, check out the [Viewer Walkthrough](viewer-walkthrough.md) or our
more advanced guide for [Logging Data in C++](../tutorial/cpp.md) where we will explore the core concepts that make
Rerun tick and log our first non-trivial dataset.

If you'd rather learn from examples, check out the [example gallery](/examples) for some more realistic examples, or browse the [Types](../reference/types.md) section for more simple examples of how to use the main datatypes.
There's also a stand-alone example that shows [interop with Eigen and OpenCV](https://github.com/rerun-io/cpp-example-opencv-eigen).

To learn more about how to work with your own types, check the [Custom Collection Adapter](https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun/tree/latest/examples/cpp/custom_collection_adapter) example on how to zero-copy adapt to Rerun types
and the [Use custom data](../howto/extend/custom-data.md) page for completely custom types.

To learn more about how to configure the C++ SDK's CMake file, check [CMake Setup in Detail](https://ref.rerun.io/docs/cpp/stable/md__2home_2runner_2work_2rerun_2rerun_2rerun__cpp_2cmake__setup__in__detail.html).
