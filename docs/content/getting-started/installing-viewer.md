## Installing the SDK

### C++

If you're using CMake you can add the SDK to your project using `FetchContent`:

```cmake
include(FetchContent)
FetchContent_Declare(rerun_sdk URL
    https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun/releases/latest/download/rerun_cpp_sdk.zip)
FetchContent_MakeAvailable(rerun_sdk)
```

For more details see [Build & Distribution](https://ref.rerun.io/docs/cpp/stable/index.html#autotoc_md8) in the C++ reference documentation.
You'll additionally need to install the Viewer, see [below](#installing-the-viewer)

### Python

-   `pip install rerun-sdk` via pip
-   `conda install -c conda-forge rerun-sdk` via Conda

Either way this includes both the SDK & the Viewer and you're ready to go!

### Rust

Add the [Rerun crate](https://crates.io/crates/rerun) using `cargo add rerun`. You'll additionally need to install the Viewer, see [below](#installing-the-viewer).

## Installing the Viewer

The [Viewer](../reference/viewer/overview.md) can be installed independent of the library language you're using.
Make sure that your library version matches the version of the Viewer you're using, because [our data format is not yet stable across different versions](https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun/issues/6410).

There are many ways to install the viewer. Please pick whatever works best for your setup:

-   Download `rerun-cli` for your platform from the [GitHub Release artifacts](https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun/releases/latest/).
-   Via Cargo
    -   `cargo binstall rerun-cli` - download binaries via [`cargo binstall`](https://github.com/cargo-bins/cargo-binstall)
    -   `cargo install rerun-cli` - build it from source (this requires Rust 1.76+)
-   Together with the Rerun [Python SDK](./quick-start/python.md):
    -   `pip3 install rerun-sdk` - download it via pip
    -   `conda install -c conda-forge rerun-sdk` - download via Conda
    -   `pixi global install rerun-sdk` - download it via [Pixi](https://pixi.sh/latest/)

In any case you should be able to run `rerun` afterwards to start the Viewer.
You'll be welcomed by an overview page that allows you to jump into some examples.
If you're facing any difficulties, don't hesitate to [open an issue](https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun/issues/new/choose) or [join the Discord server](https://discord.gg/PXtCgFBSmH).

The Rerun Viewer has built-in support for opening many kinds of files, and can be [extended to open any other file type](./data-in/open-any-file.md) without needing to modify the Rerun codebase itself.
