title: What is Rerun?
order: 0
---

Rerun is an SDK and viewer for visualizing and interacting with multimodal data streams.
The SDK lets you send data from anywhere, and the viewer,
which consists of an in-memory database and a visualization engine,
collects the data and aligns it so that you can scroll back and forth in time to understand what happened.

Rerun is
- Free to use
- Simple to integrate and get started with
- Usable from C++, Python, and Rust
- Powerful, flexible, and extensible
- Built in Rust to be cross platform and fast
- Open source, dual licensed under MIT and Apache 2

Rerun is used by engineers and researchers in fields like robotics,
spatial computing, 2D/3D simulation, and finance to verify, debug, and demo.

1. Stream multimodal data from your code by logging it with the Rerun SDK
2. Visualize and interact with live or recorded streams, whether local or remote
3. Build layouts and customize visualizations interactively in the UI or through the SDK
4. Extend Rerun when you need to

## How does it work?
That's a big question for a welcome page. The short answer is that
Rerun goes to extreme lengths to make handling and visualizing
multimodal data streams easy and performant.
