title: What is Rerun?
order: 0
---

Rerun is building the multimodal data stack to model, ingest, store, query and view robotics-style data.
It's used in areas like robotics, spatial and embodied AI, generative media, industrial processing, simulation, security, and health.

## Open source: visualization and log handling
The open source project combines simple and flexible log handling with a fast, embeddable visualizer.
Itâ€™s easy to get started and can be used as a stand alone library.

The data model is a time aware Entity Component System (ECS), designed for domains like robotics and XR.
The project includes a custom database query engine and rendering engine, both built around this model.

## Commercial: multimodal data handling at scale
The commercial offering is managed infrastructure to ingest, store, analyze, and stream large amounts of robotics-style data.
It's built around Rerun's open source data model to make data pipelines simple to build, and easy to operate with built-in visual debugging.

It gives you a single database interface to operate on data from multiple sources, including MCAP, proprietary log-formats, LeRobot Datasets,
and multimodal table formats like Lance.

It's under development with select partners. [Get in touch](https://5li7zhj98k8.typeform.com/to/a5XDpBkZ) if you'd like to be one of them.

1. Use the Rerun SDK to log multimodal data from your code or load it from storage
2. View live or recorded data in the standalone viewer or embedded in your app
3. Build layouts and customize visualizations interactively in the UI or through the SDK
4. Query recordings to get clean dataframes into tools like Pandas, Polars, or DuckDB
5. Extend Rerun when you need to

## How does it work?
That's a big question for a welcome page. The short answer is that
Rerun goes to extreme lengths to make handling and visualizing
multimodal data streams easy and performant.
