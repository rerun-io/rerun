description: How to use the Rerun SDK to log big chunks of data in one call
---


Sometimes you want to send big chunks of data to Rerun efficiently. To do so, you can use `send_columns`.

`send_columns` lets you efficiently log the state of an entity over time, logging multiple time and component columns in one call.

In contrast to the `log` function, `send_columns` does NOT add any other timelines to the data. Neither the built-in timelines `log_time` and `log_tick`, nor any [user timelines](../../concepts/timelines.md). Only the timelines explicitly included in the call to `send_columns` will be included.

### Using `send_columns` for logging points
Each row the in the component column can be a batch of data, e.g. a batch of positions.
This lets you log the evolution of a point cloud over time efficiently.
