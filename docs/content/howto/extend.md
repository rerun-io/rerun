title: Extend Rerun
hidden: true
---

There are currently two major ways of extending Rerun. You can use Rerun with [your own custom data](logging-and-ingestion/custom-data.md), or [extend the Rerun Viewer](visualization/extend-ui.md) (currently Rust only).

The goal is for Rerun to become easy to extend at every level. For example, with plugins for
- data sources
- data stores
- data transforms
- custom rendering
- custom UI interactions

If you're in need of a particular kind of extension mechanism that we don't yet support. Head over to [GitHub](https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun/issues) and either upvote an existing issue or open a new one.
