If you have made changes to your blueprint and you would like to save or share these changes,
you can do so by saving your blueprint to an `.rbl` file.

## Saving a blueprint

To save your blueprint, go to the file-menu and choose "Save Blueprint…"

Once you have saved a blueprint, you can load it again.

When loading a blueprint, it must match the "application_id" used by the recording.

To load a blueprint, go to the file-menu and choose "Open…" and select the `.rbl` file you would like to load.
