title: Install arrow-cpp with pixi
order: 6

[Pixi](https://prefix.dev/docs/pixi/overview) is a convenient tool for managing cross-platform project dependencies. In
fact, Rerun uses it for our own internal development dependency management, and you will find `pixi.toml` files in most
of our external examples.

## Installing Pixi
On Mac or Linux you can just run:
```
curl -fsSL https://pixi.sh/install.sh | bash
```
Or on Windows:
```
iwr -useb https://pixi.sh/install.ps1 | iex
```

Alternatively if you are already a `cargo` user, you can install `pixi` via:
```
cargo install pixi
```

See the [Pixi installation guide](https://prefix.dev/docs/pixi/overview#installation) for other installation options.

## Adding Pixi to your own project

If you want to use `pixi` to manage dependencies in your own project, you can simply run `pixi init` in the root of your
project folder. This will create a `pixi.toml` file that manages the project. After that you can run
`pixi add arrow-cpp==10.0.1` to add arrow-cpp as a dependency to your project.

Now, any pixi tasks added to your project will have access to the `arrow-cpp` library.

Even without tasks, you can run `pixi shell` to create a shell environment where all your project dependencies
(including `arrow-cpp`) will be available. You can use this `pixi shell` to run you project's build commands.

Check out the [pixi docs](https://prefix.dev/docs/pixi/basic_usage) for more information on what you can do with pixi.

## Using a global install of arrow-cpp

If you're not ready to use pixi for your project, you can still use it to install `arrow-cpp` globally by running
`pixi global install arrow-cpp`. However, in this case you will need to also tell `cmake` how to find the packages:
```bash
export CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=$HOME/.pixi/envs/arrow-cpp:$CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
```

## Pixi in action

The rerun-cpp example: <https://github.com/rerun-io/cpp-example-opencv-eigen> ships with a `pixi.toml` file to manage
its dependencies, as well as a set of tasks to simplify running it.

If you have pixi installed, all you need to do to run the example is:
```
git clone https://github.com/rerun-io/cpp-example-opencv-eigen
cd cpp-example-opencv-eigen
pixi run example
```

## Known Issues

⚠️ [#4050](https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun/issues/4050) `arrow-cpp` needs to be held back to 10.0.1 to avoid conflicts
with the `rerun-sdk` package when installed in the same pixi environment.

⚠️ On Windows pixi only downloads release binaries which are **not** compatible with debug builds, causing runtime crashes. For debug builds you have to build Arrow yourself, see [Building Arrow C++](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/developers/cpp/building.html).
