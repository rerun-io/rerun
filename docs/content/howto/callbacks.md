We support registering callbacks to Viewer events in these environments:

- Web browsers, through our [JS package](./integrations/embed-web.md#callbacks)
- Jupyter notebooks, through our [Notebook API](./integrations/embed-notebooks.md#reacting-to-events-in-the-viewer)

See the linked articles for more information.
