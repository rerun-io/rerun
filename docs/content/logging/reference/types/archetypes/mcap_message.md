⚠️ **This type is _unstable_ and may change significantly in a way that the data won't be backwards compatible.**
The binary payload of a single MCAP message, without metadata.

This archetype represents only the raw message data from an MCAP file. It does not include
MCAP message metadata such as timestamps, channel IDs, sequence numbers, or publication times.
The binary payload represents sensor data, commands, or other information encoded according
to the format specified by the associated channel.

See [`archetypes.McapChannel`](https://rerun.io/docs/reference/types/archetypes/mcap_channel) for channel definitions that specify message encoding,
[`archetypes.McapSchema`](https://rerun.io/docs/reference/types/archetypes/mcap_schema) for data structure definitions, and the
[MCAP specification](https://mcap.dev/) for complete format details.
