## [Rerun](getting-started/what-is-rerun) is a visualization toolbox for real-world AI
Rerun lets you log images, point clouds, and other rich data as easily as you log text. View data live or record it for
later analysis. Utilize data-specific views to get a deeper understanding of your algorithms and application. Explore the entire lifetime of your application by navigating through time.

Rerun is made up of two main components:
 - The [Rerun Library](reference/library) lets you log data from [python](getting-started/python) or [rust](getting-started/rust)
 - The [Rerun Viewer](reference/viewer) lets you view data live or from a recording.
