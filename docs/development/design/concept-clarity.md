title: Concept clarity
order: 1

The concepts that we come up with need to be extremely clear. For ourselves and for our users. We need to have a shared understanding of what Rerun is, what we are building and what the various parts of Rerun are called.

Take a product like Github. Think about all the concepts you know so well: Issues, pull requests, branches, merging etc. Every Github user on the planet has a shared understanding of what Github is. Every marketing page, conference talk, e-book and tweet uses the same language when talking about Github features. That is concept clarity.

Concept clarity makes a product easy to use. It makes building a community easy since everyone speaks the same language. And it makes the product resilient since competitors will appear messy and disorganized in comparison.
