We use various techniques to convey depth in our user interface. Most importantly, we use background color and shadows.

### Using colors to convey depth

In dark mode, lighter colors appear closer to the user. Use this to your advantage. If designing a floating element, like a modal, choose a lighter background color. This will help create a sense of elevation.

### Using shadows to convey depth

Elements with big shadows appear closer to the user. Choose shadows that appropriately conveys the right amount of depth.
