This is the high-level documentation for rerun that is hosted at https://www.rerun.io/docs

## Other documentation
API-level documentation is built from source-code. Python lives at [rerun_py](https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun/tree/main/rerun_py) and Rust in the individual [crates](https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun/tree/main/crates).

Contributions are welcome via pull-request. Note that even landed PRs will not deploy to the main site
until the next time we roll out a site-update. We will generally to do this at least once per release.

## Organization

```
