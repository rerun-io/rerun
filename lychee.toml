# Config for the link checker lychee.
#
# Download & learn more at:
# https://github.com/lycheeverse/lychee
#
# Example config:
# https://github.com/lycheeverse/lychee/blob/master/lychee.example.toml
#
# Run `lychee . --dump` to list all found links that are being checked.
#
# Note that by default lychee will only check markdown and html files,
# to check any other files you have to point to them explicitly, e.g.:
# `lychee **/*.rs`
# To make things worse, `exclude_path` is ignored for these globs,
# so local runs with lots of gitignored files will be slow.
# (https://github.com/lycheeverse/lychee/issues/1405)
#
# This unfortunately doesn't list anything for non-glob checks.
