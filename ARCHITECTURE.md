## The major components
### Logging APIs
It all starts with logging. You can log rich data (point clouds, images, etc) with either our Python SDK or our Rust SDK.

The logging SDK:s encodes the data using Apache Arrow (see more below).

The logging data can be written to disk as `.rrd` files, or transmitted over TCP to either a Rerun Viewer or a Rerun Server.

### Rerun viewer
The Rerun Viewer is where log data is visualized. It is usually run as a native app, but can also be compiled to WebAssembly (Wasm) and run in a browser.

#### Native viewer
The easiest way to launch the viewer is directly from the logging API with `viewer.init("my_app", spawn=True)`. However, the standalone viewer can also be run from the command line, for example to view an `.rrd` file: `rerun mydata.rrd`.

#### Web viewer
You can try running the viewer in a browser using `viewer.serve()` in python, or using `rerun --web-viewer mydata.rrd`.

The web viewer consists of just a few small files - a thin `.html`, a `.wasm` blob, and an auto-generated `.js` bridge for the wasm. These files are served using the [`re_web_viewer_server`](https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun/tree/latest/crates/re_web_viewer_server) crate.

The web viewer can load `.rrd` files (just drag-drop them into the browser), or read logging data streamed over WebSockets.

### `.rrd` files
`.rrd` ("**R**e**r**un **D**ata") is just a bunch of log messages appended one after the other to a file.

NOTE: `.rrd` files do not yet guarantee any backwards or forwards compatibility. One version of Rerun will likely not be able to open an `.rrd` file generated by another Rerun version.


## Technologies we use
### Apache Arrow
[Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/) is a language-independent columnar memory format for arbitrary data. We use it to encode the log data when transmitting it over the network or storing it in an `.rrd` file. We also use it in our in-RAM data store, [`re_arrow_store`](crates/re_arrow_store/README.md).

In rust, we use the [`arrow2` crate](https://crates.io/crates/arrow2).

### `wgpu`
The Rerun Viewer uses the [`wgpu`](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu) graphics API. It provides a high-performance abstraction over Vulkan, Metal, D3D12, D3D11, OpenGLES, WebGL and [WebGPU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebGPU). This lets us write the same code graphics code for native as for web.

We use the WebGL backend when compiling for web. Once WebGPU is available in most browsers, we can easily switch to it for a nice performance boost!

We have written our own high-level rendering crate on top of `wgpu`, called [`re_renderer`](crates/re_renderer/README.md).

### `egui`
The GUI in the Rerun Viewer is using [`egui`](https://www.egui.rs/), a cross-platform, [immediate mode GUI](https://github.com/emilk/egui#why-immediate-mode).

We use [`eframe`](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/master/crates/eframe), the egui framework, to run `egui` on both native and web.


### Wasm
Wasm (short for [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/)) is a binary instruction format supported by all major browser.
The Rerun Viewer can be compiled to Wasm and run in a browser.

Threading support in Wasm is nascent, so care must we taken that we don't spawn any threads when compiling for `wasm32`.

Wasm has no access to the host system, except via JS calls (something that may change once [WASI](https://wasi.dev/) rolls out), so when compiling for `wasm32` you can NOT use the Rust standard library to:
* Access files
* Read environment variables
* Get the current time (use [`instant`](https://crates.io/crates/instant) instead)
* Use networking (use [`ehttp`](https://github.com/emilk/ehttp), [`reqwest`](https://github.com/seanmonstar/reqwest), or [`ewebsock`](https://github.com/rerun-io/ewebsock) instead)
* etc


## Immediate mode
The Rerun Viewer uses an [immediate mode GUI](https://github.com/emilk/egui#why-immediate-mode), [`egui`](https://www.egui.rs/). This means that each frame the entire GUI is being laid out from scratch.

In fact, the whole of the Rerun Viewer is written in an immediate mode style. Each rendered frame it will query the in-RAM data store, massage the results, and feed it to the renderer.

The advantage of immediate mode is that is removes all state management. There is no callbacks that are called when some state has already changed, and the state of the blueprint is always in sync with what you see on screen.

Immediate mode is also a forcing function, forcing us to relentlessly optimize our code.
This leads to a very responsive GUI, where there is no "hickups" when switching data source or doing time scrubbing.

Of course, this will only take us so far. In the future we plan on caching queries and work submitted to the renderer so that we don't perform unnecessary work each frame. We also plan on doing larger operation in background threads. This will be necessary in order to support viewing large datasets, e.g. several million points. The plan is still to do so within an immediate mode framework, retaining most of the advantages of stateless code.
