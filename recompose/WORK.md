# NOW

**P14_architectural_pivot** - Major redesign: Tasks as Jobs, not Steps.

See `proj/P14_architectural_pivot_TODO.md` for full design.

**Key changes:**
- Tasks map to GHA **jobs** (not steps) - each job runs one task via CLI
- `@flow` removed - tasks calling tasks is just Python, no graph building
- `@taskclass` removed - no class-state sync across GHA jobs
- `@automation` orchestrates multi-job workflows with inferred `needs:`
- Artifacts, secrets, outputs, setup declared in `@task` decorator
- Generated workflow steps use app's entry_point (copy-paste runnable locally)

**Backup branch:** `jleibs/recompose-backup-flows-as-steps` preserves old approach.

**Current phase:** Design review. Ready to begin Phase 1 implementation.

# UPCOMING

1. Phase 1: Task decorator enhancements (outputs, artifacts, secrets, setup)
2. Phase 2: Automation framework (job(), context tracking, dependencies)
3. Phase 3-5: Triggers, workflow generation, dispatchable
4. Phase 6-7: Cleanup old code, migration, documentation

# DEFERRED

**Visual step grouping** - A `@step` decorator for local output grouping
- Purely cosmetic for tree-view output
- No GHA implications
- Consider after core implementation is stable

# RECENTLY COMPLETED

Previous work preserved in `jleibs/recompose-backup-flows-as-steps`:
- P01-P13: Foundation through TaskClass in flows
- Full flow-as-steps model with subprocess isolation
- GHA generation for flows → single-job workflows

# ARCHITECTURE DECISIONS

## New Hierarchy (P14)

- **Task** - Single unit of work, maps to one GHA job
- **Automation** - Orchestrates tasks as multi-job workflow with `needs:`
- **Dispatchable** - Wrapper to make a task workflow_dispatch triggerable

## Key Principles

1. **What you see is what you run** - Generated steps use actual CLI commands
2. **Explicit over magic** - `.job()` calls explicit, dependencies from references
3. **Validate at construction** - Automations validate during decoration
4. **String outputs for GHA** - Embrace GitHub's string-based job outputs

## Task Decorator Parameters

| Parameter | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `outputs` | String outputs (to GITHUB_OUTPUT) |
| `artifacts` | File artifacts (upload/download) |
| `secrets` | Required secrets (from GHA or local file) |
| `setup` | Override default GHA setup steps |
