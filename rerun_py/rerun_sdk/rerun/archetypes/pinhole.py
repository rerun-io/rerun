        Update only some specific fields of a `Pinhole`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        clear_unset:
            If true, all unspecified fields will be explicitly cleared.
        image_from_camera:
            Camera projection, from image coordinates to view coordinates.
        resolution:
            Pixel resolution (usually integers) of child image space. Width and height.

            Example:
            ```text
            [1920.0, 1440.0]
            ```

            `image_from_camera` project onto the space spanned by `(0,0)` and `resolution - 1`.
        camera_xyz:
            Sets the view coordinates for the camera.

            All common values are available as constants on the [`components.ViewCoordinates`][rerun.components.ViewCoordinates] class.

            The default is `ViewCoordinates::RDF`, i.e. X=Right, Y=Down, Z=Forward, and this is also the recommended setting.
            This means that the camera frustum will point along the positive Z axis of the parent space,
            and the cameras "up" direction will be along the negative Y axis of the parent space.

            The camera frustum will point whichever axis is set to `F` (or the opposite of `B`).
            When logging a depth image under this entity, this is the direction the point cloud will be projected.
            With `RDF`, the default forward is +Z.

            The frustum's "up" direction will be whichever axis is set to `U` (or the opposite of `D`).
            This will match the negative Y direction of pixel space (all images are assumed to have xyz=RDF).
            With `RDF`, the default is up is -Y.

            The frustum's "right" direction will be whichever axis is set to `R` (or the opposite of `L`).
            This will match the positive X direction of pixel space (all images are assumed to have xyz=RDF).
            With `RDF`, the default right is +x.

            Other common formats are `RUB` (X=Right, Y=Up, Z=Back) and `FLU` (X=Forward, Y=Left, Z=Up).

            NOTE: setting this to something else than `RDF` (the default) will change the orientation of the camera frustum,
            and make the pinhole matrix not match up with the coordinate system of the pinhole entity.

            The pinhole matrix (the `image_from_camera` argument) always project along the third (Z) axis,
            but will be re-oriented to project along the forward axis of the `camera_xyz` argument.
        image_plane_distance:
            The distance from the camera origin to the image plane when the projection is shown in a 3D viewer.

            This is only used for visualization purposes, and does not affect the projection itself.
