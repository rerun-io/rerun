    Sets the view coordinates for the camera.
    The default is "RDF", i.e. X=Right, Y=Down, Z=Forward, and this is also the recommended setting.
    This means that the camera frustum will point along the positive Z axis of the parent space,
    and the cameras "up" direction will be along the negative Y axis of the parent space.

    The camera frustum will point whichever axis is set to `F` (or the oppositve of `B`).
    When logging a depth image under this entity, this is the direction the point cloud will be projected.
    With XYZ=RDF, the default forward is +Z.

    The frustum's "up" direction will be whichever axis is set to `U` (or the oppositve of `D`).
    This will match the negative Y direction of pixel space (all images are assumed to have xyz=RDF).
    With RDF, the default is up is -Y.

    The frustum's "right" direction will be whichever axis is set to `R` (or the oppositve of `L`).
    This will match the positive X direction of pixel space (all images are assumed to have xyz=RDF).
    With RDF, the default right is +x.

    Other common formats are "RUB" (X=Right, Y=Up, Z=Back) and "FLU" (X=Forward, Y=Left, Z=Up).

    NOTE: setting this to something else than "RDF" (the default) will change the orientation of the camera frustum,
    and make the pinhole matrix not match up with the coordinate system of the pinhole entity.

    The pinhole matrix (the `child_from_parent` argument) always project along the third (Z) axis,
    but will be re-oriented to project along the forward axis of the `camera_xyz` argument.
