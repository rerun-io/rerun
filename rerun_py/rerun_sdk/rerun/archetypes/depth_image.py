    **Archetype**: A depth image, i.e. as captured by a depth camera.

    Each pixel corresponds to a depth value in units specified by [`components.DepthMeter`][rerun.components.DepthMeter].

    Example
    -------
    ### Depth to 3D example:
    ```python
    import numpy as np
    import rerun as rr

    depth_image = 65535 * np.ones((200, 300), dtype=np.uint16)
    depth_image[50:150, 50:150] = 20000
    depth_image[130:180, 100:280] = 45000

    rr.init("rerun_example_depth_image_3d", spawn=True)

    # If we log a pinhole camera model, the depth gets automatically back-projected to 3D
    rr.log(
        "world/camera",
        rr.Pinhole(
            width=depth_image.shape[1],
            height=depth_image.shape[0],
            focal_length=200,
        ),
    )

    # Log the tensor.
    rr.log("world/camera/depth", rr.DepthImage(depth_image, meter=10_000.0, colormap="viridis"))

        Update only some specific fields of a `DepthImage`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        clear_unset:
            If true, all unspecified fields will be explicitly cleared.
        buffer:
            The raw depth image data.
        format:
            The format of the image.
        meter:
            An optional floating point value that specifies how long a meter is in the native depth units.

            For instance: with uint16, perhaps meter=1000 which would mean you have millimeter precision
            and a range of up to ~65 meters (2^16 / 1000).

            Note that the only effect on 2D views is the physical depth values shown when hovering the image.
            In 3D views on the other hand, this affects where the points of the point cloud are placed.
        colormap:
            Colormap to use for rendering the depth image.

            If not set, the depth image will be rendered using the Turbo colormap.
        depth_range:
            The expected range of depth values.

            This is typically the expected range of valid values.
            Everything outside of the range is clamped to the range for the purpose of colormpaping.
            Note that point clouds generated from this image will still display all points, regardless of this range.

            If not specified, the range will be automatically estimated from the data.
            Note that the Viewer may try to guess a wider range than the minimum/maximum of values
            in the contents of the depth image.
            E.g. if all values are positive, some bigger than 1.0 and all smaller than 255.0,
            the Viewer will guess that the data likely came from an 8bit image, thus assuming a range of 0-255.
        point_fill_ratio:
            Scale the radii of the points in the point cloud generated from this image.

            A fill ratio of 1.0 (the default) means that each point is as big as to touch the center of its neighbor
            if it is at the same depth, leaving no gaps.
            A fill ratio of 0.5 means that each point touches the edge of its neighbor if it has the same depth.

            TODO(#6744): This applies only to 3D views!
        draw_order:
            An optional floating point value that specifies the 2D drawing order, used only if the depth image is shown as a 2D image.

            Objects with higher values are drawn on top of those with lower values.
            Defaults to `-20.0`.
