    """
    Log a double-precision scalar that will be visualized as a timeseries plot.

    The current simulation time will be used for the time/X-axis, hence scalars
    cannot be timeless!

    Examples
    --------
    ```python
    import math

    import rerun as rr

    rr.init("rerun_example_scalar", spawn=True)

    for step in range(0, 64):
        rr.set_time_sequence("step", step)
        rr.log("scalar", rr.TimeSeriesScalar(math.sin(step / 10.0)))
    ```

    ```python

    from math import cos, sin, tau

    import numpy as np
    import rerun as rr

    rr.init("rerun_example_scalar_multiple_plots", spawn=True)
    lcg_state = np.int64(0)

    for t in range(0, int(tau * 2 * 100.0)):
        rr.set_time_sequence("step", t)

        # Log two time series under a shared root so that they show in the same plot by default.

        # Log scattered points under a different root so that they shows in a different plot by default.
        lcg_state = (1140671485 * lcg_state + 128201163) % 16777216  # simple linear congruency generator

        Create a new instance of the TimeSeriesScalar archetype.

        Parameters
        ----------
        scalar:
             The scalar value to log.
        radius:
             An optional radius for the point.

             Points within a single line do not have to share the same radius, the line
             will have differently sized segments as appropriate.

             If all points within a single entity path (i.e. a line) share the same
             radius, then this radius will be used as the line width too. Otherwise, the
             line will use the default width of `1.0`.
        color:
             Optional color for the scalar entry.

             If left unspecified, a pseudo-random color will be used instead. That
             same color will apply to all points residing in the same entity path
             that don't have a color specified.

             Points within a single line do not have to share the same color, the line
             will have differently colored segments as appropriate.
             If all points within a single entity path (i.e. a line) share the same
             color, then this color will be used as the line color in the plot legend.
             Otherwise, the line will appear gray in the legend.
        label:
             An optional label for the point.

             TODO(#1289): This won't show up on points at the moment, as our plots don't yet
             support displaying labels for individual points.
             If all points within a single entity path (i.e. a line) share the same label, then
             this label will be used as the label for the line itself. Otherwise, the
             line will be named after the entity path. The plot itself is named after
             the space it's in.
        scattered:
             Specifies whether a point in a scatter plot should form a continuous line.

             If set to true, this scalar will be drawn as a point, akin to a scatterplot.
             Otherwise, it will form a continuous line with its neighbors.
             Points within a single line do not have to all share the same scatteredness:
             the line will switch between a scattered and a continuous representation as
             required.
