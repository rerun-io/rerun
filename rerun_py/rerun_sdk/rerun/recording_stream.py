class RecordingStream:
    """
    A RecordingStream is used to send data to Rerun.

    You can instantiate a RecordingStream by calling either [`rerun.init`][] (to create a global
    recording) or [`rerun.new_recording`][] (for more advanced use cases).

    Multithreading
    --------------

    A RecordingStream can safely be copied and sent to other threads.
    You can also set a recording as the global active one for all threads ([`rerun.set_global_data_recording`][])
    or just for the current thread ([`rerun.set_thread_local_data_recording`][]).

    Similarly, the `with` keyword can be used to temporarily set the active recording for the
    current thread, e.g.:
    ```
    with rec:
        rr.log_points(...)
    ```

    See also: [`rerun.get_data_recording`][], [`rerun.get_global_data_recording`][],
    [`rerun.get_thread_local_data_recording`][].

    Available methods
    -----------------

    Every function in the Rerun SDK that takes an optional RecordingStream as a parameter can also
    be called as a method on RecordingStream itself.

    This includes, but isn't limited to:

    - Metadata-related functions:
        [`rerun.is_enabled`][], [`rerun.get_recording_id`][], …
    - Sink-related functions:
        [`rerun.connect`][], [`rerun.spawn`][], …
    - Time-related functions:
        [`rerun.set_time_seconds`][], [`rerun.set_time_sequence`][], …
    - Log-related functions:
        [`rerun.log_points`][], [`rerun.log_mesh_file`][], …

    For an exhaustive list, see `help(rerun.RecordingStream)`.

    Micro-batching
    --------------

    Micro-batching using both space and time triggers (whichever comes first) is done automatically
    in a dedicated background thread.

    You can configure the frequency of the batches using the following environment variables:

    - `RERUN_FLUSH_TICK_SECS`:
        Flush frequency in seconds (default: `0.05` (50ms)).
    - `RERUN_FLUSH_NUM_BYTES`:
        Flush threshold in bytes (default: `1048576` (1MiB)).
    - `RERUN_FLUSH_NUM_ROWS`:
        Flush threshold in number of rows (default: `18446744073709551615` (u64::MAX)).
