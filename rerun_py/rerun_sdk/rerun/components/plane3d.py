    **Component**: An infinite 3D plane represented by a unit normal vector and a distance.

    Any point P on the plane fulfills the equation `dot(xyz, P) - d = 0`,
    where `xyz` is the plane's normal and `d` the distance of the plane from the origin.
    This representation is also known as the Hesse normal form.

    Note: although the normal will be passed through to the
    datastore as provided, when used in the Viewer, planes will always be normalized.
    I.e. the plane with xyz = (2, 0, 0), d = 1 is equivalent to xyz = (1, 0, 0), d = 0.5
