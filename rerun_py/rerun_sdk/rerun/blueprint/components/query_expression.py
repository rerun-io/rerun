    **Component**: An individual query expression used to filter a set of [`datatypes.EntityPath`][rerun.datatypes.EntityPath]s.

    Each expression is either an inclusion or an exclusion expression.
    Inclusions start with an optional `+` and exclusions must start with a `-`.

    Multiple expressions are combined together as part of [`archetypes.ViewContents`][rerun.blueprint.archetypes.ViewContents].

    The `/**` suffix matches the whole subtree, i.e. self and any child, recursively
    (`/world/**` matches both `/world` and `/world/car/driver`).
    Other uses of `*` are not (yet) supported.
