    Each expression is either an inclusion or an exclusion expression.
    Inclusions start with an optional `+` and exclusions must start with a `-`.

    Multiple expressions are combined together as part of `SpaceViewContents`.

    The `/**` suffix matches the whole subtree, i.e. self and any child, recursively
