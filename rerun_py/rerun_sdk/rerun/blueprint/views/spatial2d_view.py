        Construct a blueprint for a new Spatial2DView view.

        Parameters
        ----------
        origin:
            The `EntityPath` to use as the origin of this view.
            All other entities will be transformed to be displayed relative to this origin.
        contents:
            The contents of the view specified as a query expression.
            This is either a single expression, or a list of multiple expressions.
            See [rerun.blueprint.archetypes.SpaceViewContents][].
        name:
            The display name of the view.
        visible:
            Whether this view is visible.

            Defaults to true if not specified.
        background:
            Configuration for the background of the space view.
        visual_bounds:
            The visible parts of the scene, in the coordinate space of the scene.

            Everything within these bounds are guaranteed to be visible.
            Somethings outside of these bounds may also be visible due to letterboxing.
