    **Archetype**: Configures what range of the timeline is shown on a view.

    Whenever no visual time range applies, queries are done with "latest at" semantics.
    This means that the view will, starting from the time cursor position,
    query the latest data available for each component type.

    The default visual time range depends on the type of view this property applies to:
    - For time series views, the default is to show the entire timeline.
    - For any other view, the default is to apply latest-at semantics.

    The visual time range can be overriden also individually per entity.
