        Create a new instance of the EyeControls3D archetype.

        Parameters
        ----------
        position:
            The cameras current position.
        look_target:
            The position the camera is currently looking at.

            If this is an orbital camera, this also is the center it orbits around.
        spin_speed:
            What speed, if any, the camera should spin around the eye-up axis when in orbit mode.
        eye_up:
            The up-axis of the eye itself, in world-space.

            Initially, the up-axis of the eye will be the same as the up-axis of the scene (or +Z if
            the scene has no up axis defined).

            A zero vector is valid and will result in 3 degrees of freedom.
        kind:
            The kind of the eye for the spatial 3D view.

            This controls how the eye movement behaves when the user interact with the view.
            Defaults to orbital.
        speed:
            Translation speed of the eye in the view (when using WASDQE keys to move in the 3D scene).

            The default depends on the control kind.
            For orbit cameras it is derived from the distance to the orbit center.
            For first person cameras it is derived from the scene size.
        tracking_entity:
            Currently tracked entity.

            If this is a camera, it takes over the camera pose, otherwise follows the entity.
