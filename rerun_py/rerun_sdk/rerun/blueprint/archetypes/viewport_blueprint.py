            Whether or not views should be created automatically.

            If `true`, the viewer will only add views that it hasn't considered previously (as identified by `past_viewer_recommendations`)

        past_viewer_recommendations:
            Hashes of all recommended views the viewer has already added and that should not be added again.

            This is an internal field and should not be set usually.
            If you want the viewer from stopping to add views, you should set `auto_views` to `false`.
