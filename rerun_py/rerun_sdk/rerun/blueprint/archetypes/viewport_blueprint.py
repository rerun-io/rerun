        Parameters
        ----------
        root_container:
            The layout of the space-views
        maximized:
            Show one tab as maximized?
        auto_layout:
            Whether the viewport layout is determined automatically.

            If `true`, the container layout will be reset whenever a new space view is added or removed.
            This defaults to `false` and is automatically set to `false` when there is user determined layout.
        auto_space_views:
            Whether or not space views should be created automatically.

            If `true`, the viewer will only add space views that it hasn't considered previously (as identified by `past_viewer_recommendations`)
            and which aren't deemed redundant to existing space views.
            This defaults to `false` and is automatically set to `false` when the user adds space views manually in the viewer.
        past_viewer_recommendations:
            Hashes of all recommended space views the viewer has already added and that should not be added again.

            This is an internal field and should not be set usually.
            If you want the viewer from stopping to add space views, you should set `auto_space_views` to `false`.

            The viewer uses this to determine whether it should keep adding space views.
