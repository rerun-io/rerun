    Internal API to log a text entry, with optional level.

    This implementation doesn't support extension components, or the exception-capturing decorator
    and is intended to be used from inside the other rerun log functions.

    Parameters
    ----------
    entity_path:
        The object path to log the text entry under.
    text:
        The text to log.
    level:
        The level of the text entry, e.g. "INFO" "ERROR", â€¦.
    color:
        Optional RGB or RGBA in sRGB gamma-space as either 0-1 floats or 0-255 integers, with separate alpha.
    timeless:
        Whether the text entry should be timeless.
    recording:
        Specifies the [`rerun.RecordingStream`][] to use.
        If left unspecified, defaults to the current active data recording, if there is one.
        See also: [`rerun.init`][], [`rerun.set_global_data_recording`][].
