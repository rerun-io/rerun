        Construct a new AnyBatchValue.

        The value will be attempted to be converted into an arrow array by first calling
        the `as_arrow_array()` method if it's defined. All Rerun Batch datatypes implement
        this function so it's possible to pass them directly to AnyValues.

        If the object doesn't implement `as_arrow_array()`, it will be passed as an argument
        to [pyarrow.array][] .

        Note: rerun requires that a given component only take on a single type.
        The first type logged will be the type that is used for all future logs
        of that component. The API will make a best effort to do type conversion
        if supported by numpy and arrow. Any components that can't be converted
        will be dropped, and a warning will be sent to the log.

        If you are want to inspect how your component will be converted to the
        underlying arrow code, the following snippet is what is happening
        internally:

        ```
        np_value = np.atleast_1d(np.array(value, copy=False))
        pa_value = pa.array(value)
        ```

        ----------
        name:
            The name of the component.
        value:
            The data to be logged as a component.
        drop_untyped_nones:
            If True, any components that are None will be dropped unless they have been
            previously logged with a type.

        Construct a new AnyValues bundle.

        Each kwarg will be logged as a separate component using the provided data.
         - The key will be used as the name of the component
         - The value must be able to be converted to an array of arrow types. In
           general, if you can pass it to [pyarrow.array][] you can log it as a
           extension component.

        All values must either have the same length, or be singular in which
        case they will be treated as a splat.

        Note: rerun requires that a given component only take on a single type.
        The first type logged will be the type that is used for all future logs
        of that component. The API will make a best effort to do type conversion
        if supported by numpy and arrow. Any components that can't be converted
        will result in a warning (or an exception in strict mode).

        `None` values provide a particular challenge as they have no type
        information until after the component has been logged with a particular
        type. By default, these values are dropped. This should generally be
        fine as logging `None` to clear the value before it has been logged is
        meaningless unless you are logging out-of-order data. In such cases,
        consider introducing your own typed component via
        [rerun.ComponentBatchLike][].

        You can change this behavior by setting `drop_untyped_nones` to `False`,
        but be aware that this will result in potential warnings (or exceptions
        in strict mode).

        If you are want to inspect how your component will be converted to the
