        Construct a new AnyBatchValue.

        The value will be attempted to be converted into an arrow array by first calling
        the `as_arrow_array()` method if it's defined. All Rerun Batch datatypes implement
        this function so it's possible to pass them directly to AnyValues.

        If the object doesn't implement `as_arrow_array()`, it will be passed as an argument

        Note: rerun requires that a given component only take on a single type.
        The first type logged will be the type that is used for all future logs
        of that component. The API will make a best effort to do type conversion
        if supported by numpy and arrow. Any components that can't be converted
        will be dropped, and a warning will be sent to the log.
