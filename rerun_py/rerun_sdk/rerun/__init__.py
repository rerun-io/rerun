    """
    Initialize the Rerun SDK with a user-chosen application id (name).

    You must call this function first in order to initialize a global recording.
    Without an active recording, all methods of the SDK will turn into no-ops.

    For more advanced use cases, e.g. multiple recordings setups, see [`rerun.new_recording`][].

    Parameters
    ----------
    application_id : str
        Your Rerun recordings will be categorized by this application id, so
        try to pick a unique one for each application that uses the Rerun SDK.

        For example, if you have one application doing object detection
        and another doing camera calibration, you could have
        `rerun.init("object_detector")` and `rerun.init("calibrator")`.
    recording_id : Optional[str]
        Set the recording ID that this process is logging to, as a UUIDv4.

        The default recording_id is based on `multiprocessing.current_process().authkey`
        which means that all processes spawned with `multiprocessing`
        will have the same default recording_id.

        If you are not using `multiprocessing` and still want several different Python
        processes to log to the same Rerun instance (and be part of the same recording),
        you will need to manually assign them all the same recording_id.
        Any random UUIDv4 will work, or copy the recording id for the parent process.
    spawn : bool
        Spawn a Rerun Viewer and stream logging data to it.
        Short for calling `spawn` separately.
        If you don't call this, log events will be buffered indefinitely until
        you call either `connect`, `show`, or `save`
    default_enabled
        Should Rerun logging be on by default?
        Can overridden with the RERUN env-var, e.g. `RERUN=on` or `RERUN=off`.
    init_logging
        Should we initialize the logging for this application?
    strict
        If `True`, an exceptions is raised on use error (wrong parameter types etc).
        If `False`, errors are logged as warnings instead.
    exp_init_blueprint
        (Experimental) Should we initialize the blueprint for this application?
    exp_add_to_app_default_blueprint
        (Experimental) Should the blueprint append to the existing app-default blueprint instead of creating a new one.

        If true (_not_ the default), the newly initialized recording will replace the current
        active one (if any) in the thread-local scope.
