    """
    Initialize the Rerun SDK with a user-chosen application id (name).

    You must call this function first in order to initialize a global recording.
    Without an active recording, all methods of the SDK will turn into no-ops.

    For more advanced use cases, e.g. multiple recordings setups, see [`rerun.new_recording`][].

    !!! Warning
        If you don't specify a `recording_id`, it will default to a random value that is generated once
        at the start of the process.
        That value will be kept around for the whole lifetime of the process, and even inherited by all
        its subprocesses, if any.

        This makes it trivial to log data to the same recording in a multiprocess setup, but it also means
        that the following code will _not_ create two distinct recordings:
        ```
        rr.init("my_app")
        rr.init("my_app")
        ```

        To create distinct recordings from the same process, specify distinct recording IDs:
        ```
        from uuid import uuid4
        rr.init("my_app", recording_id=uuid4())
        rr.init("my_app", recording_id=uuid4())
        ```

    Parameters
    ----------
    application_id : str
        Your Rerun recordings will be categorized by this application id, so
        try to pick a unique one for each application that uses the Rerun SDK.

        For example, if you have one application doing object detection
        and another doing camera calibration, you could have
        `rerun.init("object_detector")` and `rerun.init("calibrator")`.

        Application ids starting with `rerun_example_` are reserved for Rerun examples,
        and will be treated specially by the Rerun Viewer.
        In particular, it will opt-in to more analytics, and will also
        seed the global random number generator deterministically.
    recording_id : Optional[str]
        Set the recording ID that this process is logging to, as a UUIDv4.

        The default recording_id is based on `multiprocessing.current_process().authkey`
        which means that all processes spawned with `multiprocessing`
        will have the same default recording_id.

        If you are not using `multiprocessing` and still want several different Python
        processes to log to the same Rerun instance (and be part of the same recording),
        you will need to manually assign them all the same recording_id.
        Any random UUIDv4 will work, or copy the recording id for the parent process.
    spawn : bool
        Spawn a Rerun Viewer and stream logging data to it.
        Short for calling `spawn` separately.
        If you don't call this, log events will be buffered indefinitely until
        you call either `connect`, `show`, or `save`
    default_enabled
        Should Rerun logging be on by default?
        Can be overridden with the RERUN env-var, e.g. `RERUN=on` or `RERUN=off`.
    init_logging
        Should we initialize the logging for this application?
    strict
        If `True`, an exception is raised on use error (wrong parameter types, etc.).
        If `False`, errors are logged as warnings instead.
        If unset, this can alternatively be overridden using the RERUN_STRICT environment variable.
        If not otherwise specified, the default behavior will be equivalent to `False`.
    default_blueprint
        Optionally set a default blueprint to use for this application. If the application
        already has an active blueprint, the new blueprint won't become active until the user
        clicks the "reset blueprint" button. If you want to activate the new blueprint
        immediately, instead use the [`rerun.send_blueprint`][] API.
