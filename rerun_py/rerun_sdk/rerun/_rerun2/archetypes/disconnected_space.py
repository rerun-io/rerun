    Specifies that the entity path at which this is logged is disconnected from its parent.

    This is useful for specifying that a subgraph is independent of the rest of the scene.

    If a transform or pinhole is logged on the same path, this archetype's components
    will be ignored.

    --------
    ```python

    import rerun.experimental as rr2

    # These two points can be projected into the same space..
    rr2.log("world/room1/point", rr2.Points3D([[0, 0, 0]]))
    rr2.log("world/room2/point", rr2.Points3D([[1, 1, 1]]))

    # ..but this one lives in a completely separate space!
    rr2.log("world/wormhole", rr2.DisconnectedSpace(True))
