    Set the current time of a timeline for this thread.

    Used for all subsequent logging on the same thread, until the next call to
    [`rerun.set_index`][], [`rerun.reset_time`][] or [`rerun.disable_timeline`][].

    For example: `set_index("frame_nr", sequence=frame_nr)`.

    There is no requirement of monotonicity. You can move the time backwards if you like.

    You are expected to set exactly ONE of the arguments `sequence`, `timedelta`, or `datetime`.
    You may NOT change the type of a timeline, so if you use `timedelta` for a specific timeline,
    you must only use `timedelta` for that timeline going forward.

    The columnar equivalent to this function is [`rerun.IndexColumn`][].

    Parameters
    ----------
    timeline : str
        The name of the timeline to set the time for.
    recording:
        Specifies the [`rerun.RecordingStream`][] to use.
        If left unspecified, defaults to the current active data recording (if there is one).
        See also: [`rerun.init`][], [`rerun.set_global_data_recording`][].
    sequence:
        Used for sequential indices, like `frame_nr`.
        Must be an integer.
    timedelta:
        Used for relative times, like `time_since_start`.
        Must either be in seconds, a [`datetime.timedelta`][], or [`numpy.timedelta64`][].
        For nanosecond precision, use `numpy.timedelta64(nanoseconds, 'ns')`.
    datetime:
        Used for absolute time indices, like `capture_time`.
        Must either be in seconds since Unix epoch, a [`datetime.datetime`][], or [`numpy.datetime64`][].
        For nanosecond precision, use `numpy.datetime64(nanoseconds, 'ns')`.
