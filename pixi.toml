# Pixi is a package management tool for developers.
# Before running a task, pixi ensures that all listed dependencies are installed first.
#
# Run the tasks with `pixi run TASK`, e.g. `pixi run codegen`.
# Extra CLI argument after `pixi run TASK` are passed to the task cmd.
# Lists tasks with `pixi task list`
#
# Type `pixi shell` to enter the pixi environment.
#
# https://prefix.dev/docs/pixi/overview

# We currently assume pixi version 0.34.0
# You can check that your environment is correct by running:
# - python scripts/check_env.py
# - pixi run check-env

[environments]
# The default environment is meant to serve as the basis for common development and
# CI tasks. If you are only working in rust, this is the only environment you need.
#
# For practical reasons, this environment includes the utilities necessary to build
# the python wheel. However, it does not come with the rerun python bindings installed.
#
# To run code that uses python or cpp bindings, you will generally need to use one of
# the more specialized environments: `py` or `cpp`.
# - The python-dev feature is not included in the default environment because it can
#   lead to unexpected (lengthy) Rerun build during environment creation.
# - The cpp feature cannot be included in the default environment because
#   it breaks compillation of the rerun client on linux. See: https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun/issues/6852

# The cpp environment is for building any code that depends on the C++ `rerun-sdk`.
#
# ⚠️ This environment sets the C/C++ compiler to the system compiler (see c-compiler/cxx-compiler dependencies).
# As of writing this breaks building the web viewer on MacOS, so do not enable it in any environment
# in which you want to do viewer builds.

# The wheel-test environment is for testing the python package when built from a wheel.

# It does not include the features necessary for a source-build of the wheel.
#
# WARNING: wheel-test default depends on a published `rerun-sdk` version which will
# be installed from pypi and not from the local source code.
#
# To update the wheel artifact that is registered with pixi, you can use `pixi_install_wheel.py`.
# For example:
# ```
# pixi run python scripts/ci/pixi_install_wheel.py --feature python-pypi --package rerun-sdk --dir wheel

[feature.base.dependencies]
# IMPORTANT: do not add any dependencies here that may break CI. All dependencies should be available on all supported
# platforms (including linux-aarch64), or added conditionally.
#
# Hints:
# - To check a given package, go to the package on https://prefix.dev/channels/conda-forge/. It should support:
#   - linux-64 and linux-aarch64
#   - osx-64 and osx-arm64
#   - win-64
# - Some pure Python packages may wrongly be tagged as platform-specific. In this case, use `[pypi-dependencies]`
#   instead (e.g. `nox`).
# - If a package is only used for a very specific CI job on a specific target, include it under that target (e.g.
#   `meilisearch`).
# - Last resort, use a feature to conditionally include a dependency (e.g. `taplo`).
