# Rerun C++ SDK

The Rerun C++ SDK allows logging data to Rerun directly from C++.

Read the [getting started guide](https://www.rerun.io/docs/getting-started/cpp) for information on how to use the Rerun C++ SDK.

## Build & Distribution

### Overview

To avoid compatibility issues across different platforms, compiler versions and C++ standard library versions
the C++ SDK is expected to be built from source.

From a build system perspective, the SDK consists of three dependencies:

* [SDK source](https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun/tree/latest/rerun_cpp/src/)
  * this includes **both** source and header files!
* [rerun_c](https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun/tree/latest/crates/rerun_c/) static libraries
  * Rerun C is a minimal C SDK and forms the bridge to the shared Rust codebase
  * due to the rigidity of the C ABI and lack of complex standard library types in the interface,
    compatibility issues between compilers are less of a concern
    which is why offer pre-built libraries with every release for all major platforms
* [Apache Arrow C++ library](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/cpp/index.html)
  * The SDK uses this library to perform all serialization before handing data over to rerun_c
  * See [Install arrow-cpp](https://www.rerun.io/docs/howto/arrow-cpp-install) for how to install this library


### SDK bundle (`rerun_cpp_sdk.zip`)

For convenience, Rerun provides a C++ SDK bundle with every release.
(this includes our regular [Development Builds](https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun/releases/tag/prerelease)!)

This is a simple zip archive containing the SDK the [repository](https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun/tree/latest/rerun_cpp)
(excluding the tests folder) and a `lib` folder with prebuilt rerun_c libraries for all major desktop platforms.
The rerun_c libraries follow a simple name schema that the CMake script can pick up.


### Building with CMake

See [C++ SDK CMake](https://www.rerun.io/docs/reference/cpp-sdk-cmake) for deeper dive on
how to use the SDK's `CMakeLists.txt` and an overview over all CMake configuration options.

### Without CMake

In order to build without CMake, you have to add all files from the [src/](https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun/tree/latest/rerun_cpp/src/) folder
either directly to your project or a library.
In addition, you need to link the `rerun_c` libraries and the [Arrow C++ library](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/cpp/index.html).

Make sure to compile with C++17 or newer.

For more information on how to install Arrow, see [Install arrow-cpp](https://www.rerun.io/docs/howto/arrow-cpp-install).


## Development in the Rerun repository

Refer to the [build instruction](https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun/tree/latest/BUILD.md) at the repo root.

Keep in mind that all archetypes/components/datatypes are mostly generated by the [Rerun types builder](https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun/tree/latest/crates/re_types_builder).
Use `just codegen` to run code generation. Generally, all generated code files are part of the repository,
so you only have to do that if you change the data definition or make changes to `_ext.cpp` files which
extend generated types.
