# Rerun C++ SDK

The Rerun C++ SDK allows logging data to Rerun directly from C++.

## Getting Started

Read the [getting started guide](https://www.rerun.io/docs/getting-started/cpp) on how to use the Rerun C++ SDK.

### Logging

After you've [installed the viewer](https://www.rerun.io/docs/getting-started/installing-viewer) and added the SDK to your project, you can jump right in and try logging some data.

You first create a `rerun::RecordingStream` stream and spawn a viewer. You then use it to log some archetypes to a given entity path using `rerun::RecordingStream::log`:

### Streaming to disk

Streaming data to a file on disk using the .rrd format:

### Connecting

Instead of spawning a new viewer, you can also try to connect to an already open one.

### Buffering

As long as you haven't called `rerun::RecordingStream::save`/`rerun::RecordingStream::connect`/`rerun::RecordingStream::spawn`
any data will be kept in memory until you call one of these.

## Examples

As general entry point for Rerun examples check the [examples page](https://www.rerun.io/examples) on our website.
All C++ examples can be found [directly in the Rerun repository](https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun/tree/latest/examples/cpp).
Additionally, each [archetype's documentation](https://www.rerun.io/docs/reference/types) comes with at least one small self-contained code example.


## Building Blocks

The most important type in the SDK is the `rerun::RecordingStream`.
It allows you to connect to the Rerun Viewer and send data.

The built-in types are distributed to the respective namespaces:
* `rerun::archetypes`
* `rerun::components`
* `rerun::datatypes`

If you include `rerun.hpp`, all archetypes and most component types become part of the `rerun` namespace.

Check the [general doc page on types](https://www.rerun.io/docs/reference/types) to learn more.

## Build & Distribution

### Overview

To avoid compatibility issues across different platforms, compiler versions and C++ standard library versions
the C++ SDK is expected to be built from source.

From a build system perspective, the SDK consists of three dependencies:

* [SDK source](https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun/tree/latest/rerun_cpp/src/)
  * This includes **both** source and header files!
* [rerun_c](https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun/tree/latest/crates/rerun_c/) static libraries
  * Rerun C is a minimal C SDK and forms the bridge to the shared Rust codebase
  * Due to the rigidity of the C ABI and lack of complex standard library types in the interface,
    compatibility issues between compilers are less of a concern
    which is why we offer pre-built libraries with every release for all major platforms
* [Apache Arrow C++ library](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/cpp/index.html)
  * The SDK uses this library to perform all serialization before handing data over to rerun_c
  * See [Install arrow-cpp](arrow_cpp_install.md) for how to install this library


### SDK bundle (rerun_cpp_sdk.zip)

For convenience, Rerun provides a C++ SDK bundle with every release.
(this includes our regular [Development Builds](https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun/releases/tag/prerelease)!)

This is a simple zip archive containing the SDK from the [repository](https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun/tree/latest/rerun_cpp)
(excluding the `tests` folder) and a `lib` folder with prebuilt rerun_c libraries for all major desktop platforms.
The rerun_c libraries follow a simple name schema that the CMake script can pick up.


### Building with CMake

See [CMake Setup in Detail](cmake_setup_in_detail.md) for deeper dive on
how to use the SDK's `CMakeLists.txt` and an overview over all CMake configuration options.

### Without CMake

We don't have first class support for other build systems yet,
but it should be possible to setup Rerun C++ without CMake fairly easily:

You have to add all files from the [src/](https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun/tree/latest/rerun_cpp/src/) folder
either directly to your project or a library.
In addition, you need to link the `rerun_c` libraries and the [Arrow C++ library](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/cpp/index.html).
For more information on how to install Arrow, see [Install arrow-cpp](arrow_cpp_install.md).

Make sure to compile with C++17 or newer.

#### Bazel

There's a user provided minimal Bazel example here: https://github.com/kyle-figure/bazel-minimal-rerun/


## Development in the Rerun repository

Refer to the [build instruction](https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun/tree/latest/BUILD.md) at the repo root.

Keep in mind that all archetypes/components/datatypes are mostly generated by the [Rerun types builder](https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun/tree/latest/crates/re_types_builder).
Use `just codegen` to run code generation. Generally, all generated code files are part of the repository,
so you only have to do that if you change the data definition or make changes to `_ext.cpp` files which
extend generated types.

## Tested compilers

The Rerun C++ SDK requires a C++17 compliant compiler.

As of writing we tested the SDK against:
* Apple Clang 14, 15
* GCC 9, 10, 12
* Visual Studio 2022
