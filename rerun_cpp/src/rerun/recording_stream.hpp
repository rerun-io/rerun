    /// ## Multithreading and ordering
    ///
    /// Internally, all operations are linearized into a pipeline:
    /// - All operations sent by a given thread will take effect in the same exact order as that
    ///   thread originally sent them in, from its point of view.
    /// - There isn't any well defined global order across multiple threads.
    ///
    /// This means that e.g. flushing the pipeline (`flush_blocking`) guarantees that all
    /// previous data sent by the calling thread has been recorded; no more, no less.
    /// (e.g. it does not mean that all file caches are flushed)
    ///
    /// ## Shutdown
    ///
    /// The `RecordingStream` can only be shutdown by dropping all instances of it, at which point
    /// it will automatically take care of flushing any pending data that might remain in the
    /// pipeline.
    ///

    /// set it as a the global.

    ///
    /// Internally, the stream will automatically micro-batch multiple log calls to optimize
    /// transport.

    /// more information.
