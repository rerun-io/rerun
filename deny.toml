# Install: `cargo install cargo-deny`
# Check: `cargo deny check`.
#
# For finding duplicate dependencies:  cargo deny check bans --hide-inclusion-graph


# Note: running just `cargo deny check` without a `--target` can result in
# false positives due to https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny/issues/324
