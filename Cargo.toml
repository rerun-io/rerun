# When using alpha-release, always use exact version, e.g. `version = "=0.x.y-alpha.z"
# This is because we treat alpha-releases as incompatible, but semver doesn't.
# In particular: if we compile rerun 0.3.0-alpha.0 we only want it to use
# re_log_types 0.3.0-alpha.0, NOT 0.3.0-alpha.4 even though it is newer and semver-compatible.

[patch.crates-io]
# Try to avoid patching crates! It prevents us from publishing the crates on crates.io.
# If you do patch always prefer to patch to a commit on the trunk of the upstream repo.
# If that is not possible, patch to a branch that has a PR open on the upstream repo.
# As a last resport, patch with a commit to our own repository.
# ALWAYS document what PR the commit hash is part of, or when it was merged into the upstream trunk.
